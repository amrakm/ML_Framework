110018,"“Today, as in the past,” reads the title of this wine. Rich and full, it was aged on the lees to give extra weight and body. The result is ripe with yellow fruits as well as citrus, with full-bodied flavor. It could well age until 2015.",France,Sauvignon Blanc,92,28.0
14618,"Crisp, dry and searing in acidity, this 100% varietal wine is complex, showing sour lemon and brine notes, with orange blossom tones weaving their way throughout. A delight on the palate, the wine takes on structured weight toward the finish, making sure to leave an impression.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,91,22.0
108512,"Light and lovely, this has just under 2% residual sugar, but it tastes drier than that. Arresting scents of jasmine tea and honeysuckle give it an enticing floral character. It glides into a soft palate dappled with accents of flowers, oils and incense. Includes small amounts of Chardonnay and Gewürztraminer.",US,Riesling,90,10.0
129544,"Borra's blend of 80% Petite Sirah, 10% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre has three strong personalities vying for attention with Petite Sirah definitely dominant in juicy, blueberry fruit and a core of dusty tannins, with just a suggestion of meaty game. Structured this is a nice wine to pair with a rich risotto or leg of lamb.",US,Red Blend,89,35.0
85383,"The spirit of South Africa's Swartland region shines through on this rustic but fun Shiraz. On the nose, red fruit and a spicy edge lead into big flavors of spice, smoke and fruit. Sturdy tannins give the wine an ageworthy appeal. Pair with grilled meat and heartier flavors for extra enjoyment.",South Africa,Shiraz,87,19.0
97607,"Full bodied and opulent in classic Meursault style, this ripe, yellow-fruited wine is full of ripe fruits layered in wood notes. There's a sense of power and generosity throughout. It's a wine that will develop over the medium term, so drink from 2015.",France,Chardonnay,91,
48087,"This has balsamic aromas of roasted black fruit, autumn leaf, coconut and oak. It feels big, fruity and a bit raw, with black cherry, dark plum and cassis flavors. The finish is dark, spicy and chocolaty. This is totally New World in style, aroma and flavor.",Chile,Cabernet Franc,88,18.0
37917,"Rounded and soft, this has currant and sweet apple flavors balanced with its acidity. It is concentrated and rich, and there's still some aging potential.",France,Champagne Blend,91,90.0
100480,"Soft and gluey, with sweet, jammy flavors of pineapples and butterscotch. Tastes like cough drops.",US,Chardonnay,80,28.0
16586,"Bésoleil gains complexity with each new vintage. Grenache makes up the bulk of the blend, plus 18% Mourvèdre, 11% Cinsault and 6% Syrah. Deliciously spicy with cranberry, raspberry and other red fruit flavors, this tightly wound wine will reward decanting. The minerality and supple tannins suggest that it may be cellared as well.",US,Rhône-style Red Blend,92,45.0
86139,"Delicious apple aromas give a wine that is as fresh as possible, with a pear skin texture. It's bright with almost a prickle on the tongue. Apples, grapefruit and other citrus fruits dominate this mouth-watering wine. Screwcap.",Austria,Grüner Veltliner,89,24.0
33905,"This opens with earthy scents of scorched soil, underbrush and a hint of game. Made with 90% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and Mammolo, the chewy palate offers dried black cherry, ripe plum and ground pepper alongside tightly woven tannins. Drink 2016–2019.",Italy,Red Blend,89,50.0
86914,"Still young, raw and a bit oaky, this well-balanced wine just needs some more time to smooth itself out. All the right elements are there, from the polished fruit to the tangy acids to the toasty oak (slightly more than half is barrel fermented). This is a firm, fruity style, well-made and lively. Best Buy.",US,Chardonnay,88,13.0
60467,"This estate-grown white is consistently yummy, tangy in lemon peel and fresh-squeezed lemon, with a splash of fresh grapefruit. Dry and crisp, it finishes refreshingly, an ideal wine for light appetizers and most rewardingly, raw oysters.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,88,17.0
50799,"Firm, closed wine that exhibits a strong tannin character. The wine is powerful and dense, its black plum fruits lying under the dry structure. There is a touch of alcohol burn—a shame in an otherwise well-made wine.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86,14.0
122914,"Restrained on the nose, this blend of 41% Grenache, 32% Syrah and 22% Mourvèdre offers black plum, milk chocolate, purple flower and vanilla on the nose. Black peppercorns show strongly on the palate along with black-plum skins and cola, but this still needs some bottle age to emerge to full potential.",US,Rhône-style Red Blend,89,52.0
116087,"Not dry at all, as the label promises, but overtly sweet, with vapid, sugary flavors of raspberries and cola.",US,Rosé,81,14.0
68439,"One of a pair of wines that are named after the soils on which the vines grow, this comes from clay and chalk earth on the terraces of the Lot river. It is structured and still dense, needing several years to mature. Packed tannins still lie over the generous ripe fruits. Drink from 2019.",France,Malbec,90,25.0
75283,"Spicy new-oak flavors dominate the modest fruit notes in this over-worked wine, knocking it off balance.",US,Pinot Noir,84,15.0
22673,"Luscious white peach and apricot flavors are anchored by a steely core of mineral in this easy-drinking but elegant wine. Light bodied but persistent, it's a lip-smacking, sweet wine that finishes with a touch of brambly herbaceousness. Drink now through 2020.",Germany,Riesling,90,17.0
98708,"An almost honeyed nose tells of the 2015 ripeness, but instead leads to a concentrated palate that intriguingly combines peppery spice, savory herbs and rich mellow yeast. All this richness is tempered by a streamlined lemony acidity. This is savory, so make sure to pair it with subtle, expressive food. What a joy.",Austria,Grüner Veltliner,92,28.0
13535,"This is for drinking now with chicken or beef tacos. It defines the approachable style of drink-me-now Pinot Noir, with rich, complex flavors of raspberry and cherry jam, vanilla, buttered toast and cinnamon. The silky texture and vibrant acidity are nearly perfect.",US,Pinot Noir,92,40.0
14635,"Herbal aromas of fynbos and menthol lead the bouquet of this wine, with supporting notes of blackberry, boysenberry and Thin Mint. The medium-weight palate is well balanced, with ample acidity and fine yet structured tannins. Earthy licorice and sweet spice notes grace the medium-length finish. Drink now–2020.",South Africa,Pinotage,90,35.0

118638,"Pure red fruit seems to have a bruised apple edge. The palate is simple and easy-drinking and despite its pretty ruby color comes across as a rosé, with barely a touch of tannin. Chill this for a surprise at a party.",France,Pinot Noir,86,17.0
1317,"A bright, floral fragrance invites one to further explore this softly structured wine. It's layered with ripe red fruit, leather and pepper flavors that are carried into the finish by tight, grippy tannins.",US,Petite Sirah,90,42.0
30886,"With its raisiny aroma that hits the nose first, this lacks desirable freshness. On the light- to medium-bodied palate, a strawberry note surfaces, which leads into the short-lived finish.",US,Rosé,82,14.0
122939,"Full-bodied and plush yet vibrant and imbued with fresh fruit, this is simply superb. The oak is present but never dominant, adding brown sugar and cinnamon elements to blueberry, roasted meat, espresso and black olive notes. A hint of peppery spice also creeps into this impossibly complex wine. The finish combines power, length, freshness and dusty tannins, suggesting that while impressive now, it should age well. Drink now–2030.",Australia,Shiraz,98,125.0
71005,"Aged in neutral oak and 100% varietal, this is a fine value. There is great fruit flavor—raspberry and Bing cherry—supported with natural acidity and just a hint of chocolate. This could be a Dry Creek Zinfandel, in terms of its bright berry fruit and lively acidity.",US,Sangiovese,90,16.0
45673,"A lively crisp wine, flavored with soft pear, green plum oregano, streaked through with vibrant acidity. It's light, fresh, ready to drink.",Portugal,Portuguese White,88,7.0
93685,"Maderized and stalky smelling, with a scratchy palate and grassy, pickled flavors that lean toward strawberry and raspberry.",Spain,Rosé,80,10.0
28552,"A wine so soft it could almost have been sweetened, tasting of candies and fruit bonbons. There is just some acidity, giving it the possibility of being a pleasant apéritif wine. Screwcap.",France,Chardonnay,82,

88550,"Kunde's Reserve is all about the oak—rich buttered toast, caramel and butterscotch flavors. It overshadows the underlying fruit, but makes for a decadently pleasant sip.",US,Chardonnay,85,35.0
110798,"A rather closed nose leads to a citric, ever so slightly peppery palate. The body approaches on light feet, with an almost weightless freshness. If you like it feather-light, this is your wine, just a silky touch of bracing acidity and an ultraclean finish.",Austria,Grüner Veltliner,90,26.0
5523,"Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it. The palate is round but oily in feel, while flavors of saline water, pithy citrus and bitter melon finish peppery and soft, with low acidity.",Spain,Godello,83,17.0
125546,"The plum, fresh herb, cherry and spice aromas of this 100% varietal offering are alluring but restrained. The flavors are sweet, plump and fresh, showing a sense of elegance, with a stretched-out finish.",US,Cabernet Franc,88,36.0
107191,"L'Erta is a Tuscan expression of Chardonnay that opens with a bright, golden color and spicy aromas of candied fruit, citrus, apricot, pear, honey and a touch of spicy saffron. The wine sports a bold, saturated style.",Italy,Chardonnay,88,25.0
99864,"A young wine from a high-acid year, and it's showing a fair amount of earth and green, herbal flavor. The fruit seems just on the edge of ripe, with hints of brambly berry. Well balanced in a tough year.",US,Merlot,86,20.0
114080,"The nose is a little subdued on this wine, offering leather, red fruits and dust. Pomegranate, plum and raspberry elements arise on the palate, with some roasted game and the faintest hint of chopped herbs.",US,Cabernet Franc,85,35.0
40552,"This isn't as big and burly as some Tavels, but it packs a lot of flavor into its medium-bodied frame. Crushed-stone sensations lead the way, followed up by ample fruit, which ranges from peach and melon to red plum. Drink through the end of 2017.",France,Rosé,90,24.0
34432,"Dark violet-red in color, this wine offers a bouquet of blackberry, cassis and smoked meat. It opens softly on the palate with blueberry, cherry and white chocolate flavors, buttressed by firm but not overpowering tannins and a touch of smoke. The slightly drying finish features a soft burst of cranberry.",Israel,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,89,12.0
46304,"The fruit for this provocatively named bottling is sourced from the lower Waihopai, or “Spy Valley” section of Marlborough. It's a medium-bodied, supple wine that places the emphasis on earthy notes of beetroot and clove, and then adds in cherry fruit and vanillin. Long, savory and spicy on the finish.",New Zealand,Pinot Noir,89,30.0
42044,"This red blend, made of 65% Syrah, 28% Mourvèdre and 7% Tannat is a fresh and fruity wine that's ready to drink now. Dark berries and a touch of sweet oak flesh out the mouth, with a clean and refreshing finish.",South Africa,Red Blend,85,15.0
113258,"Tight, dry and still astringent, this should evolve slowly over the next 10 years. It has a bright ruby color, and it opens with a compact berry note followed by elegant tones of spice and white truffle.",Italy,Nebbiolo,91,
83839,"A huge, harsh Cabernet without much in the way of varietal character.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,81,30.0
120000,"Black sage, wispy black cherry, dried violets, star anise and a woody character combine for a wondrous nose on this wine by regional pioneer Dan Lee. It's rich on the palate, with clove and nutmeg adding complexity to the plum, dried cherry and fennel bulb flavors.",US,Pinot Noir,92,58.0
47182,"Made with 83% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Merlot accompanied by 5% of the indigenous variety Feteasca Neagra, this wine offers a fruit-heavy bouquet of black cherry and damson plum.

A fine network of velvety tannins retreat as a splash of brightness makes its appearance on the finish.",Romania,Red Blend,90,58.0
77177,"Edelzwicker is an Alsatian term meaning noble blend, and is applied to any blend of white wine grapes. Here it includes Gewürztraminer, Pinot Gris and Riesling.

It's very refreshing, well balanced and distinctive.",US,Edelzwicker,90,28.0
96829,"Gamy aromas of rare beef and raw lamb show on the nose of this bottling, with black peppercorn, teriyaki and a touch of caramel. The flavors are a bit primary, with Concord grape jelly, blueberry jam and candied lilac, as well as a vanilla-bean oakiness.",US,Syrah,85,28.0
2893,"The top wine from Domaine de Cause, it's huge, very dense and concentrated. There is a sense of extraction, showcased by the licorice and dark chocolate flavors. This needs to calm down to give the rich fruits a chance to shine. Give this wine 6–7 years.",France,Malbec,91,48.0
126731,"With only 2,940 bottles produced, this is a limited-edition wine that's worth the hunt. Vanilla and oaky spice aromas immediately waft from the glass, with the core of dark berries and fleshy plum fruit following shortly after. Heavy and bold on the palate, the firm structure complements the concentrated blackberry and cherry flavors. Nuances of cocoa powder and tea leaves linger on the close.",Israel,Carignan,90,56.0
122016,"A rather high-toned note akin to resin appears at first but quickly turns into the sweet notion of fir honey. The palate is honeyed, too, with a rich, almost candied center of caramelised peach. There is concentration at the core and a convincing freshness.",France,Gewürztraminer,90,29.0
57290,"Aromas of dark berry, baking spice, Alpine herb, graphite, iris and a whiff of game take center stage.

115244,"This wine makes reference to certain vineyards in France's cult Côte-Rôtie. The flavors are immaculate, suggesting fully ripened blackberries and currants, grilled wild mushrooms, black pepper and sweet oak. The tannins are thick and tough, but beautiful enough to warrant aging. One troubling aspect is acidity. It's very strong, and may take some time to smoothen out.",US,Syrah,88,45.0

19540,"Dark-skinned berry, underbrush and star anise set the tone of this full-bodied red. The palate is juicy and polished, full of ripe black cherry, tobacco, clove and tangerine zest flavors, ribbed with fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2025.",Italy,Sangiovese,90,110.0
90498,"A dusty, plummy, dark berry pie Petite Sirah from old vines grown in the Santa Clara Valley by the Guglielmo family, who have been based here since 1925.

103015,"Dusty berry aromas blend with mint and herbal notes. This Tempranillo feels grabby and pinched; flavors of baked black fruits, vanilla and dill are earthy on the finish, which is chunky but generally balanced.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend,85,17.0
102084,"Made with 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc, 15% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of black currant and baking spice. The evolved palate provides mature plum, oak and toast alongside gripping, rather drying tannins.",Italy,Red Blend,87,49.0

12772,"A beautifully balanced, elegant Pinot Noir from a great appellation that's ready to drink now. It's dry and firm in acidity, with complex flavors of cherries and raspberries, although to overemphasize the fruit gives the wrong impression. Also prominent are minerals, flowers and herbs.",US,Pinot Noir,90,40.0
112255,"This is a very delicious and accessible wine for all palates, both lavish in style and complex. Candied blackberry, fragrant rose and fennel pollen aromas introduce a palate of baked red fruit, maple syrup and brown sugar flavors. That fruit-forward richness is balanced by extreme floral character and lively acidity.",US,Merlot,93,35.0
123949,"From Mt. Eden and Wente clones grown at 1,700 feet, this under-$30 bottling shows key lime and pomelo pith freshness on the nose, backed by chalk, crushed sea shell and tangerine blossom aromas. There is a fine-grained texture to the tannins on the palate, where bright citrus fruit meets with marcona almond touches. It's simultaneously refreshing and savory.",US,Chardonnay,93,28.0
126531,"Underbrush, stewed prune, grilled herb and cedar aromas take center stage on this big bold wine.

72924,"There's a ton of inviting baking spices on the nose of this bottling, from crushed clove to nutmeg, as well as lushly stewed strawberries, bacon fat and purple flowers. It's rich and thick once sipped, certainly not a dainty wine, with baked black cherry and mace spice flavors proving hearty and delicious.",US,Pinot Noir,91,44.0
114845,"From the almost-extinct Pallagrello grape, this luminous white wine really holds its own in terms of personality and uniqueness. There are pretty mineral tones here but thanks to the wine's age (from the 2006 vintage), you'll also get more complex notes of butterscotch, caramel and apricot. You can feel the high alcohol on the close.",Italy,Pallagrello,87,19.0
58222,"Emiliana began as Vinedos Organicos Emiliana, but now goes only by Emiliana because getting certified as an organic winery proved too difficult. Still, Emiliana's vineyards are organically farmed, and this five-grape blend made by Alvaro Espinoza is intense and extracted yet still finely knit. It's a serious wine with slight herbal/pine aromas, robust red-fruit flavors, and a smooth, stylish finish. Not overdone, so drink now.",Chile,Red Blend,90,30.0

54221,"A rose garden's worth of aromas lift out of the glass in this hearty, full-bodied red, the peppery tannins somewhat grippy on the palate before settling down. Blackberry punches through on the palate, given additional color and lift from the 5% Petit Verdot.",US,Cabernet Franc,87,25.0

87468,"Fairly obvious vanilla and dill aromas work with red-fruit and resin scents to give this a “roble” sort of nose, meaning the oak is definitely there. (Roble is the word for oak in Spanish.)

20681,"This expression shows ripe fruit and a bold, creamy style. Pear and Golden Delicious apple notes give the wine momentum and the added freshness it needs.",Italy,Greco,87,24.0

18124,"The local cave cooperative has turned out a full-bodied, supple Vacqueyras under this label, plump with black cherry and plum fruit. It's an easy-drinking wine, with a spicy, leathery finish. Drink now.",France,Rhône-style Red Blend,89,29.0
117674,"Pàtrimo, a pure expression of Merlot from southern Italy, is always a crowd pleaser, but this year's edition is a tad more ripe and jammy than past vintages: 2005 was indeed a hot year. Intense aromas of black cherry and blackberry pie emerge from the nose and the wine's finish is accented by a surprise signature of tart acidity.",Italy,Merlot,88,150.0
110080,"Stalky, earthy aromas of roasted, raw berry fruits suggest underripeness. This feels solid on the exterior but weak in the middle. Creamy, oaky plum flavors have a bitter, roasted quality, while on the finish it's heavy, creamy oak in charge.",Peru,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,84,17.0
92413,"This is a deep-colored, ripe wine, with touches of wood well embedded in the spicy, rich blackberry fruits. The wine is juicy, with dry, dusty tannins promising some aging. Drink from 2016.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87,
42260,"Yellow tinted, which announces that this wine was barrel aged. And that barrel character is huge on the nose, which smells of raw oak, vanilla and dried cheese. Feels creamy, but the acidity is lively as well. Shows flashes of brilliance but also fights to absorb all the wood that's been thrown at it. A quality wine but definitely not for everyone.",Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,86,32.0
101282,"Resiny oak sticks out, while the palate is grabby and sticky in feel. This tastes like lemony pushcart hotdogs and the briny water they sit in, followed by a woody, low-fruit finish.",Argentina,Chardonnay,83,14.0
3025,"The chalk soil of the Rabenstein Vineyard has 50-year-old vines, which produce a dense, concentrated wine. Spice and mineral characters combine with creamed apple in a rich display. The wine could certainly age over the next 3–4 years. Screwcap.",Austria,Grüner Veltliner,92,29.0
100659,"89-91 Barrel sample. Very Sauvignon aromas, lovely fresh herbaceous character. The wine has a fine freshness to it, light, with fruity grapefruit and lime flavors.",France,Bordeaux-style White Blend,90,
109070,"This is crisp, with citrus and red apple fruits that are heightened by the taut structure. Nervy acidity adds to the tense feel while judicious layers of wood warm the finish. For long-term aging.",France,Chardonnay,93,94.0
38148,"This blend of 47% Grenache, 39% Syrah and 23% Mourvèdre packs dense fruit on the nose, showing plump blackberry and black plum, with touches of pepper, tar and charred beef. The palate is dry and leads with savory peppercorn and asphalt notes, then rounds out with blueberry and dried herb flavors, all balanced by spry acidity.",US,Rhône-style Red Blend,91,40.0
23986,"This noted Napa producer has excelled at Petite Sirah for a long time, and with the impressive 2010, they've out-done themselves. The wine comes from a vineyard block, said to be more than 70 years of age, that contains other varieties, such as Carignane, Grenache and Syrah. Thus, it's a field blend of the type that Italian-American vintners produced throughout much of the 20th century. Dry and tannic, with wild berry, currant, licorice, tobacco and oak flavors, the wine is wonderful now, and should develop bottle complexities until 2034.",US,Petite Sirah,93,80.0
73497,"Gently perfumed hints of ripe pear almost seem to have a floral dimension. On the palate the mellow, generous and totally ripe pear fruit unfolds fully and gives glimpses of very juicy ripe, dried and baked fruit. All of this richness is countered by lemony freshness. There is an earthy textural element, and more shimmering fruit reminiscent of bottled mirabelle plums. This is generous and just off dry, with a concentrated, convincing and very moreish balanced richness.",France,Pinot Gris,94,37.0
22647,"This wine shows strong extraction with hints of bitter chocolate as well as licorice flavors. The fruit is still compressed at this stage, with acidity showing through most prominently. The wine is solid, though, and could yield some more fruity pleasure in the future.",Austria,Austrian Red Blend,88,46.0
18949,"Delicate and detailed, this balanced Pinot Noir displays a perfect mix of wild berry, mushroom, green tea and a whiff of compost. These threads of flavor, and others associated with them, create a delightful tapestry that continues through the lengthy finish.",US,Pinot Noir,91,65.0
21559,"A little tough and gritty in the mouth, but the flavors are rich, and the wine finishes long and spicy. Underneath the edgy tannins is plenty of black cherry, currant and plum fruit. Drink now.",US,Merlot,87,20.0
120620,"This wine has a zesty structure, with good minerality and ripe yellow fruits.Tightly structured with acidity, it comes from one of the cooler villages of the Côte de Beaune and shows a lively, bright aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",France,Chardonnay,91,48.0
11589,"This lightly oxidized Chard is powdery but not entirely fresh, as it shows aromas of pool water and mealy melon. The palate is chunky and just O.K. in feel, while fleshy flavors of melon and peach end briny and mildly bitter.",Argentina,Chardonnay,83,10.0
35976,"A sour tinge of toasty oak invites one in aromatically and taste-wise in this vineyard-designate, from such a stellar Westside Road site. Gravenstein apple and melon pique the palate while it remains balanced and beautifully textured through the spicy finish.",US,Chardonnay,91,50.0
36278,"Good price for a Cab of this elegance and complexity. It's a dry, full-bodied wine, with proper varietal flavors of black currants and cedar. A great substitute for a more expensive Cab in this economy.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,15.0
52697,"The unoaked style is readily apparent on this bottling. Fresh and bright green aromas outdo the more savory ones, conveying Anjou pear, jasmine and light apple cider on the nose. Green apple and more pear show on the palate, with a pithy apple-skin flavor providing tang to the slight acidity.",US,Chardonnay,86,22.0
53657,"A blend of grapes from St. Helena and Coombsville, this is a balanced combination of warm, ripe fruit and cool-climate acidity. The flavors are ripe with black currants and new French oak. It's already throwing sediment, but it should reward additional time in the cellar. Give it until at least 2017, although it could still be rocking and rolling in 2025.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,85.0
41280,"Pithy and citrusy on the nose, but ultimately it's rather neutral. The palate is citric and lean, with orange, lemon and sour apple flavors. Zesty to the point of tartness, with a citrusy, juicy finish. A pointed SB with zing.",Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,86,11.0
41882,"Sharp, hard and stiff, this high-alcohol wine offers plenty of power, but little in the way of charm .A tight streak of burnt rubber runs through the core of black fruit.",US,Zinfandel,85,28.0
48204,"This vintage of Florus shows enormous purity and elegance and the various floral, fruit and almond aromas show seamless integration. The wine is thick, creamy and dense on the palate, but a zesty touch of acidity and chopped mint keeps it from ever feeling sticky or heavy.",Italy,Moscadello,93,
98232,"Potent up front, this deals juniper and olive aromas in spades. In the mouth, it shows good body and depth. Herbal berry and olive flavors are a touch green, which is standard for the variety, while vanilla and carob flavors on the finish are derived from heavy oak.",Chile,Carmenère,87,20.0
99335,"There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling. Don't drink this now but wait: Drink 2020–2035.",France,Riesling,95,45.0
117817,"As fresh as can be, this is a bright, lively and lightly perfumed wine. It has grapefruit, apricot fruit and a touch of minerality. Drink through 2015.",Portugal,Verdelho,86,13.0
85589,"Not at all a fruit bomb, this medium-bodied wine smells like salt and pepper, has lightly earthy and herbal flavors and a crisp mouthfeel. It will prove a pleasant accompaniment to your next lunch or dinner.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,88,16.0
74797,"A strong blast of oak comes across as resin and clove, and thus the wood doesn't augment but instead takes away from the fruit. Speaking of fruit, it's jumpy and tangy, with a finish that tastes of green olives. Overall it doesn't show proper balance or full development.",Argentina,Merlot,83,12.0
20362,"This wine is massively ripe, with black currant, dark chocolate and anise flavors. Cabernet Sauvignon brings a black currant note and tannic power, Cabernet Franc adds a cherried richness, and Merlot lends a soft, feminine touch. The result is noble, but big, thick tannins call for time in the cellar. Consider opening from 2017, although it will go for a decade or two longer than that.",US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,94,150.0
93408,"The fragrances of lemon blossoms and honeysuckle hit your nose as soon as you pop the cork on this seductive white wine. It's so flavorful, so long in fruit and exotic in spices, and finishes mercifully dry. Twenty percent of barrel fermentation adds the perfect touch of creaminess.",US,Pinot Grigio,90,26.0
110510,"This is a great example of the power that can come a Grand Cru vineyard. It's opulent and dense, but more than that it has intense energy and drive. Although the wine is marked as medium sweet, the spice and pepper give it a dry, tight, nervy edge. The wine is still young and will be best from 2017.",France,Gewürztraminer,93,48.0
93410,"Fino Sherry rarely has this kind of weight and complexity. It's full of spunk, grab and length, and that's probably due to the fact that it's made from Pedro Ximenez grapes and not the more common Palomino. Likely marvelous with garlic shrimp or langostinos.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez,90,11.0
40719,"A big, fruity Cabernet that hardly shows a day of age at nearly six years. It's still rich and ripe in blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam flavors. Drink up.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,25.0
74632,"This wine is so soft, rounded and fat. It has hints of red fruits and acidity with a herbal edge. But with the soft texture of the wine, it is misses out on fruit and acidity. Drink now.",France,Rosé,84,17.0
34572,"Delivers a rich and food friendly blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. The wine is loaded with cherry and black fruit with a rich, but not over extracted personality.",Italy,Red Blend,89,
24465,"This driving blend of Malbec with Syrah and Cabernet hails from Argentina's most northern vineyards.Bruising black plum and cassis aromas have mossy, floral sidenotes. It's grapy but not monotone, so you get boysenberry then spice flavors, especially clove. This is toasty on the finish, which has drying tannins.",Argentina,Red Blend,92,66.0
85266,"The wine shows the fine acidity of the vintage, but also intense flavors of green apples, Asian pears and oranges. Oak brings luscious, balanced notes of vanilla and toast. A gorgeous, sumptuous wine that should drink well for the next six years.",US,Chardonnay,93,50.0
66254,"Though not indicated on the label, this is sourced from a single vineyard in the Columbia Gorge AVA. Cool-site flavors abound, from the lemony fruit to the snappy acidity. The wine did not go through secondary malolactic fermentation, yet shows a tasty streak of butterscotch running through its core.",US,Pinot Gris,91,23.0
2513,"Sourced from the best barrels made at the winery in 2013, this off-dry reserve checks in with roughly 30 g/L residual sugar, and plenty of acidity to more than balance it out. It's sweet, tart and sappy, with concentrated, juicy flavors of Meyer lemon, grapefruit and tangerine. It feels full-bodied and roundly fruity, then continues to extend itself with concentrated details of mineral and acid. A wine of exceptional power and length.",US,Riesling,95,32.0
127002,"This is a solid wine with its dark tannins and structure from a vineyard close to some of the greatest Grands Crus. It is concentrated, showing the density of the appellation. There is a basic richness to this wine with its ripe black fruits. It is developing slowly and has a fine future. Drink from 2022.",France,Pinot Noir,93,135.0
92461,"Ripe fruit and acidity coexist in this wine. Flavors of luscious peaches are accompanied by smoke, almonds and tight acidity. It's definitely a wine with character, but offers further aging potential. Drink until 2019.",France,Savagnin,88,
71460,"Aromas of green bell pepper, chopped herb and crushed tomato vine lead the nose on this bright, fragrant wine. The fruity palate offers juicy white grapefruit and passion fruit alongside mouthwatering acidity. It has a clean, dry finish.",Italy,Sauvignon Blanc,87,12.0
52670,"Handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, a lovely, medium-bodied beauty that finds balance in its measured use of oak. Vanilla, plum and bold jolts of pepper and cinnamon combine well on the lengthy palate.",US,Merlot,92,35.0
47412,"This is dry and crisp in acidity, but the vegetable and citrus flavors are clumsy.",US,Grenache Blanc,82,18.0

20783,"Hailing from a very cool vintage, this is more neutral, stripped back and tough than usual. Lemony oak and generic black-fruit aromas feed into a tannic, fat palate with generic flavors of cassis and blackberry. This is big and fruity but not complex or showing a lot of character.",Chile,Carmenère,86,23.0
78068,"A bit cheesy and funky, with rhubarb and leather along with baked berry aromas. The palate feels fine, but the flavors are leathery and sort of salty, with touches of pepper and herbs as well. Not as ripe and appealing as what we're looking for from a Rioja reserva.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend,84,24.0
59694,"Named for his sons Hunter and Ryder, this is part of Guy Fieri's small wine project based in Sonoma County. The partnership with Winemaker Guy Davis of Davis Family Vineyards sources from three old-vine sites, including Doug Rafanelli's, to make a balanced wine marked by savory black olive, black pepper and a strong current of Italian deli aromas and flavors. Pillowy tannin and a shot of tobacco add nicely to the whole.",US,Zinfandel,92,40.0
37553,"Leather, menthol, dark-skinned berry and light toast aromas slowly come together on this fresh, polished wine.

9389,"Very dark and inky in color, this bottling by Matthias Pippig shows baked black plum and black cherry on the nose as well as a dusting of cocoa and elegant forest spices of juniper and pine. More baked plum and rich blueberry show on the palate, but with a considerably earthy edge of black tea, juniper, coffee and dark chocolate.",US,Red Blend,93,

43156,"From the celebrated Ravera cru, Elvio Cogno delivers a classic and elegant expression of Nebbiolo with tight tannins, long aging potential and nuanced aromas of small berry fruit, cola, leather, licorice and smoky cedar tones. Save this wine in your cellar 10 years or more.",Italy,Nebbiolo,93,75.0
32758,"Gritty aromas of severely baked berry fruits are tough to plow through. In the mouth, this Malbec is jammy, chunky and a touch flat. Flavors of stewed berries and prune finish thick and taste cooked. Ready to drink now.",Argentina,Malbec,84,27.0
121747,"Floral aromas are light and more suggestive of Pinot Noir than Syrah, with a hint of latex and mulch thrown in. A flat, sticky mouthfeel and a combination of sweet and green flavors finish with rubbery notes of latex and bitterness.",Chile,Pinot Noir-Syrah,83,12.0

98085,"Organic vineyards in the shadow of the Corton hill and the Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru provide the basis for this wine.

Drink 2019–2025.",Italy,Sangiovese,89,65.0
41710,"This rather exotic Riesling was fermented and aged in barrels, 43% new, and the rest once-used. The barrel treatment takes it away from any ordinary Riesling characteristics, yielding a wine that has much in common with Viognier—floral and buttery, with substantial alcohol.",US,Riesling,91,22.0
1384,"This is richer than most Pinot Grigios. It opens with aromas of toast, yellow flower, vanilla and a balsamic note while the round, full-bodied palate offers baked yellow apple, candied lemon drop, nectarine zest and almond. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy fruit while a vanilla note closes the finish. You can barely detect the warmth of alcohol on the close.",Italy,Pinot Grigio,88,25.0
35016,A beautiful wine that has plenty of weight and also a firm structure of minerality to go with the yellow fruits that are now evolving into more mature flavors. It is by no means at its peak yet. Give it 2–3 years.,France,Chardonnay,92,70.0
104572,"Layers of wet stones and smoke pervade this dry, deeply mineral wine. It's full in body, yet gossamer in mouthfeel and marked by searing lemon-lime acidity. Tightly wound still, it's a structured, complex wine likely to improve after 2018.",Germany,Riesling,90,70.0
111459,"Full of acidity, this is also a really fruity 100% Sauvignon Blanc. Great citrus and green apple flavors go with a mineral edge and a final fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink from late 2015.",France,Bordeaux-style White Blend,88,13.0

124905,"The top wine of the trilogy made at Château Ponzac, this is designed for aging. Mint flavors from new-wood barrels mingle with dark tannins and a concentrated texture. It is a powerful, ripe wine that certainly does need some time. Don't drink before 2020.",France,Malbec,93,44.0

17927,"Bright, crisp and fresh, as a 2009 Clare Riesling should be, this is a pretty wine, blooming on the nose with floral notes, apples and citrus fruit. The lime and green apple flavors are zesty on the finish, but not that long or intense. Probably best from now–2014, but could develop interesting nuances beyond that.",Australia,Riesling,87,20.0
41469,"Some of the grapes for this unoaked white come from old vines, as well as some from the Musque clone, making for a tart, linear taste of lemon verbena and sizzling acidity that's somewhat overshadowed by the unctuous texture and full body.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,86,22.0
15969,"Still young, this wine has a tight character that needs to open up. Since there is plenty of fruit along with perfumed acidity, it will happen. Tannins and a bitter edge need to be softened, so wait until late 2016 for this wine's potential to really show.",France,Pinot Noir,85,20.0
6358,"This winery northeast of San Diego sources from up north and experiments heavily with stem inclusion on this bottling, which shows cherry blossoms, crushed cranberries and an earthy line of anise through the nose.

28217,"This is a pretty good wine, dry, spicy and full-bodied, but it's not particularly Cabernet-ish or Napa-ish. It could be Zinfandel or Syrah or anything, with its peppery black currant and mocha flavors. It's also quite soft. Drink now.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,85,22.0

73795,"Plum and berry aromas are forward, fresh and composed. This blend of 85% Tempranillo and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon is zesty and snappy in feel, while the flavors veer toward plum and berry with toast and oak accents. A juicy, pure finish makes it easy to like.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend,87,12.0
34652,"The steep Murças vineyard on the right bank of the Douro faces due south. That gives this dense, impressive Reserva vast reserves of richness and structure.

Hold this concentrated wine until 2018.",Portugal,Portuguese Red,94,42.0

61589,"This is easy to drink, with crisp, mouthwatering acidity that brightens the lemon, lime and tropical fruit flavors. It's slightly sweet, but not overtly so—just enough to pair with Asian-inspired fare.",US,Pinot Grigio,85,12.0
109844,"This stunning red is all about finesse and light. It opens with lovely scents of violet, rose, perfumed berry and balsamic aromas while the radiant, almost ethereal palate delivers crunchy red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and mineral intensity.

66280,"A testament to coolness—cool place, cool year—this Marin County Pinot is earthy, round and tight, suggesting it could use a little more time to develop.

80593,"The winery's largest vineyard, Mount Richmond encompasses 105 acres, and yet just 752 cases of the vineyard-designated version were produced in this vintage.

86776,"There's a deeply purple touch to this bottling, with dark strawberries, dried purple flowers and a touch of vanilla laid across a clay-based minerality.

117868,"De Loach has been showing a fine appreciation of dryness, acidity and minerality in its recent Chardonnays, and this single-vineyard bottling is another example of what makes these wines so drinkably good.

69249,"From head-trained vines interspersed with Alicante Bouschet and Petite Sirah, this is a bright, likable wine, teased in bacon, cola and brown sugar that finds a fresh streak of red currant and juicy strawberry as it opens, the acidity in full view.

122975,"A rare Walla Walla Sauvignon Blanc, this is rich and round in this new vintage, fully-ripened to lush flavors of apple, pear and papaya.

111153,"A powerful and dramatic Pinot Noir. The first thing you notice is the depth. The range of flavors goes on and on, ranging from cherries, oranges and cola through mocha to more classic notes of forest floor, mushrooms and peppery spices.

39637,"This is an impressively dark, rich wine made from biodynamically grown grapes to give pure perfumed fruitiness over dense, dusty tannins.

84988,"This is a bit hard and aggressive now, with a punch of green tannins. That makes it hard to appreciate the underlying oaky, ripe blackberry and currant fruit.

17648,"Sourced from several different Dundee Hills vineyards, this wraps its black cherry fruit in tart acids, chalky minerals, and a hint of iron.

27490,"A sizable 70,000 cases of this bargain were imported, so it should be reasonably available. The citrus fruit does have a greenish tinge to it, boasting hints of passion fruit, snap pea and green onion, but they're within the bounds of regional typicity, and bring a crisp, tart edge to the finish. Drink now.",New Zealand,Sauvignon Blanc,89,14.0
39417,"A touch of campfire smoke invites the nose into this bottling from a historic vineyard. It also offers aromas of dark cranberry, black raspberry, chipped slate and roasting meat.

18514,"Among barrel-fermented Verdejos from the Rueda region, this one is at the top of what is a small hierarchy.

Long and focused on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo,90,32.0
96835,"Confected and slightly artificial, there's a thick aroma of canned pineapple syrup and rose petals on the nose, which feels a bit off balance from the much less-intense palate. Bright canned fruit lingers on the finish.",US,Vermentino,85,19.0

53547,"Although 2013 was a difficult vintage, some of the top cru wines are successful. That's the case here, with a wine that is structured and with plenty of juicy fruit. The tannins are firm, although leaving room for the cherry juice fruitiness. Drink now.",France,Gamay,89,

5624,"With its tight minerality and vivid green fruits, this is a fine representative of the freshness and richness of 2006. While Bouchard Père is generous with the wood, it does not dominate because the fruit flavor texture and finishing freshness are so important.",France,Chardonnay,90,

122504,"This gorgeous, concentrated, mouthfilling wine is delicious to sip now but will certainly improve in the cellar for a decade or more.

Drink 2016–2021.",Italy,Red Blend,92,31.0
102028,"Pungent and sweaty smelling, with nettle and other sharp aromas. Surprisingly, the palate is short on acidity so there's a flat feel along with green, salinic flavors that border on vegetal.

66185,"This smells like a typical Mosel kabinett, offering up hints of crushed stone and fresh flower-shop greenery. It's styled appropriately, with modest alcohol and a hint of residual sugar.

84720,"There's a very likable umami character to the nose of this wine, its soy and black pepper touches playing well with the lilac and dark fruit aromas.

99103,"Made for almost 40 years—since 1962—this edition of 389 sports lots of spicy American oak, and displays black fruit and tobacco aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is big, the texture rich and the full, spicy finish is long and tannic.

82790,"A new blend for Pepper Bridge, Trine is named for the three main partners and includes all five Bordeaux red grapes.

34655,"From a single vineyard of old vines, this is a deeply structured wine. The rare Jaen (in Spain the Mencia grape of the northwest) dominates and here gives a dark and dense wine. It has power, of course, but also style and elegance from the fruit and tannin balance. The strong mineral aftertaste promises further aging, so drink from 2016.",Portugal,Portuguese Red,94,45.0
71839,"92–94. Barrel sample. This is a spicy, fruity wine that has excellent acidity and a rounded, fruity character. It has some extraction, giving a bitter edge, while the final effect is a rich, juicy Merlot.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,93,
75210,"This oak-dominated wine recalls the ubiquitous wood-driven Tuscan offerings from the late 1990s and early 2000s.

65227,"This bottling is curiously at odds with the winery's other 2011 single-vineyard Pinots. It's less ripe, with a mushroomy earthiness alongside flavors of raspberries and pomegranates. You might call that Burgundian, but it does cut down on the wine's opulence, and seems to limit ageability.",US,Pinot Noir,87,50.0
10134,"Murrieta's blend of 31% Sauvignon Blanc, 27% Viognier, 15% Sémillon, 11% Pinot Blanc, 8% Orange Muscat and 8% Muscat Canellii is well-made and likable, medium-thick and somewhat sweet in style with citrus and almond accents. Delightfully quaffable.",US,White Blend,86,19.0
60529,"Gritty cassis aromas are oaky and challenging, which is what you can get when a wine spends more than three years in oak. In the mouth, this is wiry and rubbery.

102235,"Both tart and ripe red cherries characterize nose and palate. Ample, crunchy freshness gradually tips into juicy ripeness.

67669,"Toast, coffee and French oak aromas lead the nose and carry over to the one-dimensional palate along with dried cherry and a hint of dill. Soaring alcohol throws it off balance.

25885,"An opening of smoky tomato sauce, tea and earthy berry fruit turns leathery and more earthy with each passing minute.

29361,"Aromas of mango and scented potpourri set up a dry solid palate. This blend of Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay is not something you see a lot of. Flavors of white pepper and nectarine finish juicy, with notes of peach pit and orange peel.",Argentina,Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay,87,12.0
22892,This wine shows a touch of age or flatness and its ruby color also shows some mild browning. The wine will hold a few more years but the fruit tones present now won't last forever. You'll get aromas of wild berries and red apple.,Italy,Nebbiolo,88,

12254,"The rich blackberry, vanilla and toast nose sets you up for a lush, supple wine and this one does not disappoint. Full and dense, it offers rich black-cherry and cassis flavors on the palate, and a huge finish with fine-grained tannins. Very well poised for its size, it's approachable now. Nevertheless, it will be much more nuanced and show more finesse in 5–8 years. Keep for a decade or two, maybe more. To be released 5/01.",Australia,Cabernet Sauvignon,93,90.0

39978,"Smoky, elegant and soft aromas of leather, pepper and berry lead into flavors of cherry and cigarbox spice on the palate of this approachable Cabernet.

66030,"With its big, fat mouthfeel, but very little fruit to back it up, at this stage this wine seems to be about wood, spice and richness without balance. The Reserva from the property seems to have a better focus.",Portugal,Portuguese White,85,32.0
25972,"This is turning into an impressive wine as it finds its way between solid tannins and ripe, full black fruits. It is dark and dense at this stage with tannins that dominate. A more juicy character will develop as the wine ages. Drink from 2017.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,92,29.0

86044,"Compact right now, this Pinot has fine depth and a unique character. Offers a cherry, smoke and leather bouquet and displays dried cherry, licorice and mineral flavors along with a distinct chalk dust feel in the mouth and on the finish. Solid tannins and the fine depth of fruit indicate that two or three years cellaring are merited.",US,Pinot Noir,90,30.0

24117,"A little creamy, waxy and scattershot, but also far more exotic and different than most $8 wines. This is barrel-fermented Viura, but the oak level is light and manageable.

77663,"This 100% Petit Verdot introduces itself with rich, extracted fruit, in the way of blackberry and blueberry jam and sweet red currants.

17071,"Powdery berry aromas are sketchy but don't offend. This Garnacha feels jammy, rubbery and on the tannic side, while buttery accents intermingle with briny raspberry flavors. A plump, almost sticky feeling finish shows smacking tannins.",Spain,Garnacha,85,15.0
1045,"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal.

90188,"Heavy, oaky and fruity now, but it's a young Cabernet, and all the signs point to ageability.

56635,"Of all the excellent Genium 2010s, this is the only one that's a bit stalky on the nose. It's also rubbery smelling, with tight-grained oak scents and earth notes. Hard, tannic and without much cushion, this Garnacha-led blend tastes earthy, stalky and of high-toned plum and currant with lemony oak. A bold, tannic finish says this will last through about 2024.",Spain,Red Blend,90,45.0

51363,"This vineyard is regarded as the finest of the Grand Crus, certainly for its more serious character.

115012,Organically grown grapes are the source of this wine that comes from selected parcels on the Domaine de Rochoy. Flint soil gives a strongly mineral character that permeates the wine.

A lively wine with bite and modest offsetting sweetness to the overriding snap.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend,85,18.0
8937,"A dark and hearty McLaren Vale Shiraz, with plenty of weight and tannin and concentrated cola, black olive and leather flavors.

97953,"This is a bold combination of 89% Dolcetto from the Napa side of Carneros and 11% Barbera from one of its happy spots in the state, El Dorado County.

4909,"From the Vinho Verde subregion of Monção and Melgaço, this intense, bone-dry wine captures the richness of Alvarinho while not losing sight of its fresh lemon and crisp apple side. It has a tight texture that suggests the wine is still young, so drink from late 2016.",Portugal,Alvarinho,91,

91079,"This very dry Syrah has soft tannins and a full-bodied mouthfeel, with complicated flavors of baked cherries, cola, bacon and sandalwood. It's quite a good wine, but astringent now, making for a puckery feeling. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink with rich fare.",US,Syrah,87,30.0

12289,"Rich, concentrated, and loaded with smoky, dark, spicy fruit flavors, this is a full-on Bordeaux blend, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. There's plenty of barrel influence, from 70% new French oak, but it's welcome, and appropriate, perfectly matched to the power of the fruit. An underlayer of woodsy earth and mushroom adds further complexity.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,94,60.0

7147,"This Bordeaux blend feels harsh in the mouth. It just doesn't offer the richness you want from a Napa wine. The blackberry flavors are edged in overripe raisins, but the biggest problem is the bitter tannins.",US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,84,55.0
26676,"This is quite a nobly structured Pinot Noir. It's tempting to describe it as thin, because it trades opulence for dryness and a certain spicy minerality. But that would seriously underestimate its considerable appeal, not to mention the subtle hints of wild cherries and raspberries. The more you sip, the more you like it. At this price, a terrific value.",US,Pinot Noir,93,25.0

126771,"Grown in a vineyard atop the Palos Verdes peninsula on the Los Angeles coastline, this wine offers intriguing and focused aromas of lemon pith, hard apple candies and lime drizzled on white peach.

96308,"This east-facing vineyard is in the village of Fuissé. With the wood-aging giving spice and toast flavors, it is a ripe wine. The wood marches well with the apple and green-plum fruits. Still young, this rich wine has a mineral texture that comes from chalky soil. Drink from 2019.",France,Chardonnay,92,30.0
16724,"Flavors roll from cranberry to sweet red cherry in a red-fruit riot. It was aged in 52% new and 24% one-year-old oak, but it's unobtrusive and not especially toasty.

41214,"This is nominally a step up from De Bortoli's dB Selection Petite Sirah, but this fresh, directly fruity wine doesn't seem to offer much beyond jammy fruit. It's medium-bodied, with a crisp finish and just a hint of tannic structure. Drink now–2012.",Australia,Petite Sirah,84,13.0
67677,"Made from a blend of Gamay and Grolleau, this is a bright and fresh wine. There's no wood aging here, just fruit that is full of red-berry flavors and only a touch of tannin. The wine is ready to drink.",France,Red Blend,85,
15219,"Savory, rustic notes of dried mushroom and toasted nuts mingle with richly concentrated black-cherry and rose-petal flavors on this dry, medium-bodied Pinot Noir. Soft tannins and just a shade of toasted oak add richness and dimension to the palate.",US,Pinot Noir,87,16.0
113252,"Dry Creek produced this wine and then held it back all of this time to let it properly mellow. It's beautiful—softly lush, dry and complex in jammy blackberry and cherry fruit, with a spicy, briary character that makes it savory.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,91,25.0
18360,"Swathes of floral and berry tones accent this blossomy blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It's aggressively foamy and frothy, but racy, vivacious acidity keeps the palate fresh.",US,Sparkling Blend,87,34.0
107610,"The Ravazzól vineyards produce fruit with intense aromas of blackberry, chocolate and spice. In the case of this wine, those tones are further enhanced with red apple and mesquite wood. The mouthfeel is smooth and very polished.",Italy,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",92,
47822,"Made in a style that's lower in alcohol and earthier than your typical Napa Valley Cabernet, this bottling has plenty of complex elegance. The blackberry, tobacco and cedar flavors will pair well with steak. Drink now–2017.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,89,34.0
66575,"Earthy balsamic aromas become more tarry and oaky the longer this sits. In the mouth, the tannins are fierce and extremely dry. Flavors of toast and raw wood are big players, while minty, chocolaty berry notes are also in play. This seems more woody than fruity, with dry rough tannins pushing the finish. Drink through 2026.",Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,91,60.0
87338,"This is a finesse wine, with light flavors of pomegranate and cranberry. There's a suggestion of burnt toast—just a hint—around the tannins, which remain a bit stiff and chewy. Give this another year or two and it should open up further.",US,Pinot Noir,91,36.0
70009,"A solid and fully tannic wine that also has a bright, fruity side. The combination, with its ripe fruit, is already a pleasure to drink fresh, textured and juicy. The wine also has a future with a smoky character that will allow it to age. So drink until 2021.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87,15.0
79051,"This wine starts off a bit tarry or rubbery, but decanting allows the bright berry fruit to come forward. Raspberries are limned with hints of mint and other herbs and framed by vanilla. It's medium-bodied, with a tangy finish and a crisp, satiny texture. Drink now.",Australia,Shiraz,87,15.0
46984,"This wine's flavors maybe take it a step too far into baked apple and pear territory, adding superripe melon to the mix as well. It's full-bodied, silky textured and broad in the mouth, with a touch of warmth on the finish.",New Zealand,Pinot Gris,86,18.0
114156,"Loads of crushed mineral—slate and white stone—characterize the bouquet at first but are soon followed by delicate aromas of cherry cola, balsam and exotic spice. The Serragrilli Barbaresco offers an intense and pristine aromatic presentation backed by thick extraction and dense opulence.",Italy,Nebbiolo,91,
54606,"Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel. It could stand to flow and finish better than it does.",Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon,84,11.0
51916,"A majority Cabernet Sauvignon with 14% Merlot blended in, Artemis is aromatically inviting in dark plum, currant and a streak of herb. Light, lean and well-balanced, the wine features soft, barely perceptible tannins. Tri-tip is a wise pairing suggestion.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,88,55.0
89658,"This overtly woody wine smells like cedar chips and fresh-cut oak and tastes like pine, menthol and cherry candy. While it's fun to pick out its different flavors, this is not what most people expect from Cabernet.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,84,15.0
42075,"This is a tremendous value for such a good wine, made by Casey Flat Ranch winemaker Laura Barrett, a medium-textured swirl of grapefruit, melon and ripe orange. Grapes from Lake County also add a  tropical element, just right in the mix.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,88,15.0
106666,"This off-dry Riesling boasts pretty fresh apple and floral notes on the palate, but persisting notes of dried herbs and spring ramps distract. Sprightly on the palate with delicate lemon acidity.",US,Riesling,83,16.0
100443,"There's enough unripe fruity flavor in this wine to detract from its pleasure. As dry, crisp and silky as it is, its cherry and cola flavors are marred by a sharp, green taste of menthol.",US,Pinot Noir,84,25.0
82228,"Pato Frio—cold duck—suggests this a summer picnic wine. It certainly has the freshness and crisp elegance. But it also some weight, ripe apple and citrus fruits and a texture that suggests it could age a few months longer.",Portugal,Antão Vaz,87,13.0
40842,The wine has tannins and a dry core that is fleshed out with red-berry fruits. At three-years-old it is already maturing with a rustic edge as well as spice and berry fruits. This is ready to drink.,France,Pinot Noir,87,35.0

100765,Here's a great Roero Arneis from northern Italy that offers so much more personality and regional character than your average Italian white. Fresh citrus and fruit tones are backed by dusty mineral shadings that give the wine a smooth and polished feel.,Italy,Arneis,88,21.0
44156,"Kracher TBA wines are numbered in ascending order of intensity. Even at this medium level of intensity, this is an impressive wine. It has that fine balance, pushing its rich marmalade and dried apricot flavors right up to intense acidity. The wine is certainly full, but keeps a delicacy and great lightness of touch.",Austria,Scheurebe,92,86.0
10118,"This alcoholic wine (15.9%, and you can taste it) is also tongue-scrapingly tannic. The black cherry and cassis fruit is fabulous, and quite ripe, but the alcohol starts to burn out the finish. Let the record show that some tasters will love this wine.",US,Dolcetto,86,24.0
67437,"Beginning with a velvety texture and inviting bouquet of strawberry and rose, this classic blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 8% Petit Verdot and 2% Merlot is grown on the winery's 845-acre estate atop Spring Mountain.

Drink up soon.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,91,100.0
51780,"Gunn Estate's 2009 is on the green side of things, offering hints of asparagus on the nose before balancing those out nicely with white grapefruit flavors.

42639,"A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this wine offers both beefy and herbal notes among the more standard black raspberry and plum fruit flavors.

The acidity at the end is intense and tight.",France,Rosé,92,36.0

37501,"In this rich, dense wine, firm tannins have already been smoothed by 50% new wood. It is solid, dark and tannic, a powerful wine that is ripe now and will reveal great fruitiness as it ages. From vines close to Volnay, it has hints of the voluptuousness of that village. Drink from 2017.",France,Pinot Noir,93,85.0
124732,"This opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, tobacco and a whiff of cooking spice. The dense, full-bodied palate offers dark berry, licorice, vanilla and a hint of oak alongside bracing tannins. A hint of sage closes the finish.",Italy,Nebbiolo,90,100.0

46468,"A wonderful minerality, like a lick of cold granite, grounds and complicates this Chardonnay. Without that stoniness, it would be just another tropical fruit and oaky Chard, good and dry and tart, but mainstream. Yet that taste of terroir lifts it above the ordinary. Don't drink it too cold, and decant it if you can for an hour or two.",US,Chardonnay,92,40.0

13413,"Basic and a little sweet and confected, but consider the price and you should be smiling. There's some bramble and pepper to the nose, but mostly it's just ripe and full of blackberry and black plum character. Candied and almost cloying, but remains flush and happy. Good in the midlevel category.",Spain,Monastrell,86,8.0
106758,"Shows unexpected age, with brown around the edges and mature prune and orange-peel aromas. The flavors are more alive, but are not vibrant. Rather dull on the finish, this isn't bad wine but tastes like something four or five years older.",Italy,Sangiovese,83,26.0
104547,"This is Rochioli's basic Pinot Noir. It's a beautiful wine, marked by great structure and accessible fruit. Near-perfect acids and tannins lend it elegance, while the cherry and cola flavors have a rich touch of smoky oak. Drink now.",US,Pinot Noir,91,69.0
62986,"Sweet and easygoing from the start, with candied berry and floral aromas. The palate sits at maximum ripeness, meaning it's sweet and soft but still holds its balance.

48311,"At 62,000-plus cases, you are in the land of the seamless blend. Oregon does not have vast contiguous vineyards, so these grapes must have come from here, there and everywhere. The result is a gentle, lightly fruity, crisp, clean and innocuous Pinot Noir that lacks only a sense of place.",US,Pinot Noir,85,20.0
111780,"Everything here is just hinted at: a touch of tropical fruit on the nose, a faint note of nougat on the palate and a spritz of lemon over the biscuity backdrop.

112338,"This rich, smoke- and wood-flavored wine shows great potential. It also has plenty of black fruits that give it a ripe full character.

It has that hard to define quality of finesse that makes a fine sparkling wine so special.",US,Sparkling Blend,93,65.0
86726,"A green hint extends from nose to finish in this slightly austere, earthy Mosel Auslese. Linear lemon and lime tones are tinged with flint and ripple persistently on the palate.

115011,"Grown on dense chalky soil, this concentrated, tight and mineral wine is also rich. Pure acidity and rich apple flavors are cut by a nervy streak and textured with lively spice. This wine is worth aging, so drink from late 2017.",France,Sauvignon Blanc,93,35.0
1611,"Under the same ownership as Château de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit. That solid structure suggests the wine will need time to develop. The aftertaste boosts a more juicy fruitiness.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87,19.0
128588,"This wine seems a bit muddled, with aromas of cranberries, dried herbs, vanilla, cashews and barrel spices struggling to get to the surface. The palate is medium bodied with tart fruit flavors and blocky tannins, with the concentration not seeming to all be there.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,35.0

128372,"This cellar-worthy treasure has attention-grabbing spice, leather and smoky oak aromas. Ripe fruit flavors are heavily shaded with undeniably delicious accents of cedar and chocolate. It is bold in flavor, full in body and quite tannic in texture. Hold until at least 2018; the wine should improve even more after that.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,93,50.0
9610,"The quality of this wine is as high as you'd expect, given the ABC production and vineyard sourcing. Not many winemakers are able to source fruit from a Talley vineyard, but Jim Clendenen can. Beyond the raspberry, pomegranate and cola fruit flavors, what's notable about the is the acidity. It is strong and searing, and strongly suggests pairing with something rich, like lamb.",US,Pinot Noir,93,40.0
110051,"Leafy underbrush, grilled porcini, toasted hazelnut and ripe blackberry aromas unfold in the glass. The juicy (if somewhat mature) palate doles out crushed raspberry, wild cherry, licorice, crushed herb and a hint of vanilla while velvety tannins and fresh acidity provide balance and structure drink through 2020.",Italy,Sangiovese,92,

20878,"One of the original unoaked California Chardonnays, it's fresh, fruity, clean and perhaps better than ever. It smells and tastes like ripe apple, lemon and a hint of pineapple. The balance of moderate ripeness and mouth-cleansing acidity is right on the money.",US,Chardonnay,89,15.0
345,"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.",Australia,Muscat,100,350.0
14750,"Friendly inviting notes of ripe juicy pear appear immediately on the nose and are also amply present on the palate.

7048,This wine is somewhat diluted and one-dimensional. It makes a straightforward attempt at bringing a richness of apple and anise to the fore around neutral oak dynamics before finishing ripe and full.,US,Chardonnay,84,18.0
39235,"Very oaky, very buttery, very posh in texture, this wine takes the spicy richness of oak-barrel fermentation and aging to a high level. It's not at all shy about the toast, caramel and baking-spice flavors, with a mouthcoating texture that helps those accents linger on the finish.",US,Chardonnay,89,30.0
51634,"Spicy cardamom is part of the package here, where a robust flavoring of pomegranate and wild strawberry shine brightest. Smooth and tart, this medium-bodied wine is complex in additional elements of freshly tilled soil and black tea.",US,Pinot Noir,93,55.0
109838,"Nacional Vintage Port comes from a small parcel of ungrafted vines on a series of terraces at the Noval estate. It is a legendary wine, produced only occasionally.

Drink this wine from 2021 and for many years.",Portugal,Port,98,595.0

7812,"Sourced largely from Red Mountain fruit, this includes 18% Merlot in the blend. It's toasty and ripe, with the barrel flavors most evident in both nose and palate.

There is plenty of chocolate, toast, coffee and smoke as well, presumably from aging 20 months in oak.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,35.0
53482,"It's quite tannic, as is to be expected from this founding Red Mountain vineyard, and yet the wine seems smoothed over, buffed out. The black cherry and cassis fruit does not penetrate. Drink up.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,60.0

76258,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It provides a crisp counterpoint to the fruit and oak, which combine to flood the mouth with vanilla, buttered toast, honey, Meyer lemon, pineapple and nectarine flavors. Great to drink now with elaborate scallop and crab dishes.",US,Chardonnay,87,40.0
77015,"Made, very unusually for the Douro, from Sémillon, this botrytis affected wine gives ripe dried apricot and white fig flavors, boosted by the dry core of botrytis, and finishing with acidity. Definitely unexpected, but it succeeds well.",Portugal,Sémillon,88,
110320,"This is a small property under the same ownership as Château du Cartillon in the Haut-Médoc. The wine is ripe, juicy and with delicious blackberry fruits.

56244,"Herbal plum and berry aromas are gamy almost to an extreme. This multigrape blend has a lot of Syrah and Carmenère in it, and that shows. The palate is muscular in feel, and quite meaty and rustic in flavors, with tastes of olive and beef jerky. A blackened finish is more dark and oaky than fruity.",Chile,Red Blend,91,35.0
15476,"Blended with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Syrah, this medium-bodied, soft and juicy red offers notions of berry pie and dusty leather, as backbeats of chocolate and blackberry play on the palate.

108648,"The 2010 Ornellaia celebrates the wine's 25th anniversary, and it could not have been a more spectacular vintage. It opens with aromas of crushed blue flowers, black berries, pipe tobacco and thyme that give way to an elegant, structured and polished palate.

This will age and develop for decades. Drink 2016–2040.",Italy,Red Blend,97,240.0

12278,"This is the 33rd vintage of this landmark Zinfandel, which, since it's a blend that includes just 74% Zinfandel in it, isn't technically Zinfandel at all. Whatever.

48492,"Yellowish to tan in color, this young wine is already showing signs of age, but get it early and you'll find creamy but sturdy flavors of squash, kumquat and peach.

122371,"An interesting experiment, this Pinot Gris is fermented on the skins, then aged in neutral oak for six months.

27495,"Merlot makes up just over half of this wine, with Cabernet Sauvignon (39%) playing second fiddle and Cabernet Franc and Malbec rounding it out.

Acids are crisp, elegantly extending the finish.",Australia,Chardonnay,91,41.0

46804,"Kingston's top-level Pinot Noir has been a consistent scorer for the past three vintages. The 2008 starts with pure raspberry and cherry aromas as well as tea accents, while the textbook palate has a proper feel and tasty raspberry and cherry flavors.

30700,"It's hard to fall immediately in love with this Cabernet, despite the fancy Oakville address, as the tannins are so firm.

The finish is refreshing and penetrating, lingering on a note of sugar cookie.",Germany,Riesling,91,25.0
99977,"This Merlot is very tannic now, which makes it hard to drink. There are considerable cherry, berry, currant, mineral and herb flavors, but they're buried under a ton of astringency. You're best off giving the wine a good four years in the cellar to let it age it a bit.",US,Merlot,88,52.0
68143,"Cinnamon spice and pomegranate fruit give a soft touch to minerally driven aromas of black slate and wet cement on the nose of this block-designated (and trademarked!) wine.

48264,"This Amarone needs time in the glass to open and evolve.

77415,"Ripe and generous, this is another good value in Yellowtail's reserve line. Boysenberry, blueberry and delicate licorice scents work the nose, followed by sweet raspberry flavors in the mouth.

52308,"Steady, firm and tonic, this offers an informal bouquet of citrus and stone fruit followed by steely effervescence and fresh acidity. This Prosecco should pair with fried calamari or grilled shrimp.",Italy,Glera,87,17.0
37903,"With layers of coffee, spice and cedar enveloping scents of ripe black fruit and bramble, Hazlitt's Cab is beautifully composed on the nose.

105658,"Pure Cabernet sourced from a trio of Walla Walla vineyards, and finished at 14.9% alcohol. Supple and spicy, this displays a firm core of tart fruit, annotated with lead pencil, graphite and charcoal.

102829,"An almost tropical touch of passion fruit hovers above the nose as if to draw you in.

53368,"Though the alcohol comes close to 15%, this is still relatively light compared with other Spofford vineyard Syrahs.

5576,"Dynamic aromas of honeysuckle and mint gumdrop precede intense honey, orange, tangerine and marmalade flavors. This is a thicker, more oily style of Torrontes than the commonly seen watery ones, and it makes a statement via its viscosity and power.",Argentina,Torrontés,87,13.0
10207,"The lightest of the Thornton lineup marches to the beat of a different drummer. Dominated by Muscat Canelli, the aromas suggest ripe pears, buttered cinnamon toast and candied orange peel, but it’s not really sweet. In fact, it’s just barely off-dry, with wonderfully rich flavors. It finishes a little sugary, which makes it cloying, but this is a minor criticism.

13615,"This appears to be a wine that's simply over-reached. Noticeably high-toned, with a vinegary bite to the cherry flavored fruit, it's pushed it a bit too far. Not even 28 months in three quarters new French oak can mask the volatility.",US,Red Blend,84,50.0

44356,"With Pinot Noir, texture is everything, and this lovely wine is pure silk and satin. That makes it drinkable now, with its pretty flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, cinnamon butter and sandalwood. But it's also tannicly tough, with a sandpapery scour. Seems like it should mellow over the next 3–4 years, although not much beyond that.",US,Pinot Noir,92,65.0

128487,"Ripe lime aromas and a full richly fruity palate give a rounded character to this wine. Apricot juice and tangerine brighten up the palate, fitting well with the wood and fruit structure. Keep for another few months for the whole wine to fill out even more.",Portugal,Portuguese White,90,20.0
38044,"This is a bright, effusive, full-bodied wine, with underlying acidity that keeps it fresh in the glass. Apple and pear flavors combine with firm texture, providing weight and breadth.",US,Chardonnay,90,34.0
57215,"Picked at 33 brix and fermented in new French oak, this heavy, almost oily dessert wine has a floral aroma as intense as bottled perfume. Flavors suggest orange liqueur, honey and candied apricots. It pulls together just enough acidity to avoid falling into a fat, cloying finish.",US,Muscat,90,35.0
52853,"This wine from cool sites in the county overdelivers for its price. Floral pear, nutmeg and orange peel flavors give it crispness and a savory bite, as tart grapefruit notes provide additional liveliness. Focused and bright, it's well worth stockpiling.",US,Chardonnay,92,25.0
36587,"Aromas of fragrant white blossom, stone fruit, honeydew melon and tomato vine come together on this savory white. The round, medium-bodied palate offers creamy peach, tropical fruit, dried herb and an energizing mineral note. Bright acidity provides freshness and balance.",Italy,Turbiana,92,25.0

23672,"This Chardonnay is almost Chablisian—it's bone dry, bristling with acidity, and modest in alcohol. There's a lick of minerality to the lemon peel, apricot and buttered toast flavors that makes the wine tangy. It's ready to drink now.",US,Chardonnay,89,32.0
81295,"A fine, balanced wine that brings out good toastiness alongside sweet, ripe fruit. Well made, showing good balance, with acidity giving a lift to all the richness. The aftertaste is rounded and delicious.",Portugal,Portuguese Red,91,28.0
9228,"Spicy, bretty and leathery; this type of wine represents Ribera in a traditional, no-tricks light. Air only helps it show its best attributes, which revolve around meaty black fruit and herbal accents. It's chewy, sort of tannic and finishes with flavors of moss and jerky. Good for near-term consumption.",Spain,Tempranillo,87,20.0
42685,"Dry indeed; this is so dry as to be outright sour. It's an acid-lover's dream wine; but be prepared to pucker up. It's a mouthful of lemon juice, some cardboardy phenolics, and very tart green apples.",US,Riesling,84,14.0
104080,"Grapefruit and quince make for an exciting opening amidst some yeasty notes. On the palate, aromatic quince and plum notes reflect the generosity of the vintage while remaining dry and light-bodied. There is an ease here, of drinking and thinking, of sipping and being refreshed. This goes down far too easily on deceptively light feet. The finish is of refreshing lemon zest.",France,Riesling,92,26.0
28044,"This red wine might just make you purr with satisfaction. It delivers everything you want in a Merlot. It's dry, but soft, with plush tannins and rich flavors ranging from red cherries and currants to cocoa, violets and cedar.",US,Merlot,90,25.0
63196,"Barrantes is always a full-bodied Albariño from one of Rias Baixas's warmest subzones. The nose on the '07 is of doughnuts and pastry, with sweet pear kicking in. The flavors are peach, apricot and ripe citrus fruits, and the finish is pithy and wide. Plods along a bit; could stand to be lighter and smoother in scope.",Spain,Albariño,87,23.0
90788,"This wine opens with nondescript aromas of oak, espresso, coffee and plum. The low-acid, one-dimensional palate offers black cherry, oak extract, and sweet, almost sugary vanilla and butterscotch alongside evident alcohol and soft, fleeting tannins. It lacks energy and intensity, so drink soon.",Italy,Sangiovese,86,80.0
72357,"This is a light, fresh wine that shows attractive acidity while also offering some firm tannins. It has a crisp edge, but not a great amount of depth, and will probably be ready to drink soon.",France,Red Blend,86,

34450,"Maybe a little more ripe and heady than some of its Chilean buddies, but this SB from Montes offers freshness, zip and good citrus, tarragon and other green-herb flavors. The feel is good, the character fresh, and the finish long and clean. Offers maybe a little more green-leaf character than some might like, but overall this is another fine value SB from Chile. Drink immediately.",Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,87,12.0
128271,"Concentrated to the hilt, with molten black fruit, coconut and mint aromas. The palate is driven, tannic, pure and features dynamite flavors of black fruit, bitter chocolate and spice cake.

14833,"Gentle notes of creaminess and ripe pears signal a soft, creamy wine with lots of texture and body. The rounded body carries some weight and is edged with a bitter marzipan note. All this is countered by fresh acidity, more creamy, nutty notes and a vanilla finish.",France,Pinot Gris,88,24.0
37391,The wine is light and fruity—properly crisp with attractive acidity. The red fruits shine through the light texture and touch of spice creates a bright wine full of final fruitiness.,France,Rosé,88,17.0

46530,"This blend of Malbec, Bonarda, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is oaky and minty up front, with pencil lead and exotic blueberry aromas. In the mouth, this has a fast pulse, while flavors of Middle Eastern spices, cassis and blueberry finish briny but short.",Argentina,Red Blend,87,15.0
106960,"This is a tough wine, marked by hard acids and tannins, and an absence of the fruit to stand up to it. It's bone dry and severe, with thin cherry-skin and cola flavors.",US,Pinot Meunier,82,17.0
127235,"Light, spicy aromas like vanilla and nutmeg and ripe, full blackberry and cherry flavors come with a soft texture and almost sweet balance. This has lots of flavor with medium body and without drying tannins and acidity. The winemaker blended in 10% Syrah and 5% Petite Sirah.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,25.0
83033,This thin and savory wine from the Colli di Parma appellation in central Italy offers bright spice and leather with subtle tones of cassis and dried prune. Pair it with homemade pasta or ravioli with ricotta cheese.,Italy,Red Blend,87,19.0
84166,"This bottling from Kick-on Ranch is fresh and easy on the nose, with lemon-lime soda, crisp Asian pear and sweet jicama aromas, making for a refreshing experience that almost everyone can enjoy. It's light in body and acid-powered on the palate, with Pink Lady apple hints.",US,Riesling,89,25.0
116790,"It would be a pity to open this wine anytime before, say, 2010, because it needs age. Now, and for a while, it will taste closed and tannic and raw. But such are the tannins and acids and overall balance, and the core of blackberries and cherries is so rich, that it should effortlessly negotiate the next decade.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,90.0
117859,"This includes grapes from the winery's Jerusalem Hill vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA, in addition to the Dundee Hills sites, hence the more general Willamette Valley designation. It was aged in 65% new French oak for 16 months. It's open and generous, offering bright berry, cherry and red currant fruit matched to defining acids, all set in a fine-tuned frame of new oak. Re-tasted 24 hours after being opened, it remained fresh, dense and satisfying.",US,Pinot Noir,94,70.0
56765,"Made in the labor-intensive “classic method” (in which secondary fermentation occurs in the bottle), this sweet Asti sparkler is one of a kind. From the only producer to utilize this method, De Miranda offers longevity and yeasty tones of bee's wax, peach and apricot.",Italy,Moscato,90,90.0
115164,"Heavy wafts of petrol and oak dominate at first in this wine, before some air and some swirling in the glass reveal more lifted aromas and flavors of lemon candy, green apple and apple tart.

93475,"A fine spine of minerals and acidity provides welcome relief to the sweet pineapple, vanilla, buttered toast and tropical fruit flavors of this Chardonnay. It's soundly made in the popular style.",US,Chardonnay,87,25.0
7081,"De Bortoli's 2006 Estate Grown Pinot Noir lacks the bright fruit and user-friendliness of its Gulf Station or Windy Peak bottlings. Maybe it's too serious for its own good? This medium-bodied wine features leather, mushroom and molasses, and rather crisp acids as well.",Australia,Pinot Noir,82,41.0
103395,"A wine that brings out soft richness, with a creamy apple texture layered with green plum skin tannins. The wine has some tautness as well, giving a tight structure that opens up. There's a great mineral, steely streak, with freshness showing through on the finish.",France,Chardonnay,90,56.0

113807,"This is the kind of California Pinot Noir Burgundophiles love to hate. It's so full-bodied and fruity, so forward in currant, chocolate and licorice flavors, that it seems to have nowhere to go — a sin in Burgundy. And yet there's no denying its immediate deliciousness. It fools the palate, now honey sweet, now bone dry, but always rich and spicy.",US,Pinot Noir,90,56.0
17864,"Magalanne's top wine is a wood-matured blend of 40% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre and 30% Carignan. It's nicely balanced and spry on the palate, easily moving from raspberry, cherry and citrus to leather, spice and herb before ending on some stony, dusty notes. Drink it over the next year or two.",France,Rhône-style Red Blend,88,22.0
87803,"A deep, stony minerality persists from nose to finish on this light-footed Riesling. Sweetened by hints of guava and stone fruit, it's a shade off dry but endlessly refreshing. The finish lingers on a gorgeously chalky, saline note.",US,Riesling,90,18.0

70652,"This is an assertive Pinotage with a lusty edge of smoke and leather. The nose exhibits spicy red fruit and pepper and the flavors have a masculine, rustic character of spice and tobacco. Unique, intriguing, and a winner with equally robust dishes.",South Africa,Pinotage,86,14.0
16885,"A little one-dimensional, but pleasant enough, with silky flavors of cola, licorice, cherries and smoky oak. This is one of the better Pinot Noirs in this price range.",US,Pinot Noir,85,14.0
9203,"A soft apple-tinged wine, with bright acidity that cuts right through. The wine is rounded, with just enough crispness. Ready to drink.",Portugal,Portuguese White,86,9.0
20390,"This ripe, juicy and fruity wine has plenty of tannins, although they have easily integrated into the black fruits and fresh acidity. The wine is already surprisingly balanced, so although it will improve with age, it can be enjoyed now.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89,45.0
4303,"Dense, dark wine, with good black plum, fig, coffee and sweet raisin flavors. The ripe tannins fit well into this fruit mélange, with definite richness from new wood. There is good, juicy power here, as the wine finishes well with both dry tannin and fresh acidity.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89,24.0
49217,"Opens with lofty, airy aromas of flowers and pears, and then in the mouth comes a full rush of grapefruit and orange pith.

3540,"Giuseppe Nada and his son Enrico have produced an earthy and gripping Barbaresco, with floral, truffle aromas punctuated with Alpine herbs. The palate shows layers of dark cherry-berry fruit, balsamic notes of sage and mint, all backed up by a firmly tannic backbone. Best after 2016.",Italy,Nebbiolo,92,30.0
24203,"Fresh and leesy, this stainless steel-fermented Pinot Gris spent six months on the lees, giving it extra freshness and texture. Sweet grass and fresh herbs spread nicely across the palate, and the 15% alcohol does not register as such. In fact, if anything, this seems to fall on the lighter side of Oregon Pinot Gris, without the thick and heavy fresh cut pear character that many of them bring. Pair this with chanterelles in a light cream sauce.",US,Pinot Gris,87,18.0

53235,"This is named for Arnaud Puyanché, who moved to Francs to make wine but put the project on hold due to the Great War of 1914. Five generations later, the family has revived his dream of producing estate wines. Ripe and full of red fruits, this 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc is concentrated and rich.

92082,"Picture perfect Sonoma Zin, said to be made from old-vine vineyards. It's dry, softly tannic and sweetly ripe in black raspberry, cherry and blackberry fruit, with a rich earthiness and even an umami touch of grilled bacon. Delicious for drinking now.",US,Zinfandel,92,34.0
108078,"Clean and easy, this has a bright fruit aroma, plus a subtle tone of burnt almond at the back. Pair this with ravioli and smoked ricotta cheese.",Italy,Nero d'Avola,87,16.0
69698,"A flowery Chardonnay with delicate, almost evanescent flavors of buttercup, buttered toast and grapefruit. It seems overly strong in oak and weak in fruit, showing a minerally spine and raw alcohol. Clean and bone dry, but lacks richness and vibrancy.",US,Chardonnay,85,40.0

29799,"Made in open lagars, this is a full, ripe and very fruity wine. To balance this opulence, there is a strong element of wood aging, spice, dark tannins and a dense texture. This impressive wine has weight, concentration and aging potential. Drink from 2016.",Portugal,Portuguese Red,94,80.0
60114,"This seems prematurely evolved with its lifted, kerosene-like whiff on the nose, but is no less pleasant for that. Ripe stone fruit melds into a slick, oily palate guided by a seam of bright, lemony freshness. The finish is dry and bright, and flavors fill the mouth long after the last sip.",France,Riesling,89,17.0
56795,"Presented in extremely elegant packaging, this is a beautiful expression of Nebbiolo from Piedmont. Not as austere as Barolo or Barbaresco, this wine does offer familiar aromas of black currant, pressed violets, tar, licorice and leather. The wine is smooth, silky and structured on the close.",Italy,Nebbiolo,90,21.0

88240,"Aromas of rose, blue flower, wild berry and a hint of forest floor lead the way along with a balsamic note.

21103,"Herbal touches of chervil and dill combine with grapefruit zest and a slender but muscular body. Shades of pepper spice are revealed on the tight palate that culminates in a long, delicious and savory finish. Drink as of 2016.",Austria,Grüner Veltliner,94,
86269,"Vegetal aromas outmuscle the wine's green fruit character. A plump, round mouthfeel offers only mild acidity, while the vegetal essence returns on the palate, with sulfuric bitterness on the finish.",Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,83,17.0
113240,"Paumanok's portfolio is full of winning wines, but the 2010 Cabernet Franc is a particularly intoxicating mélange of ripe red-cherries and violets framed with sweet spices and herbs. Bright acidity and minerally granite tones intensify the dried cherry flavor and the lush, furry tannins.",US,Cabernet Franc,91,28.0
13316,"Earthy berry aromas are typical of good Carmenère, meaning they are lightly herbal, spicy and a touch savory. This is a ripe specimen from a hot year, so it's plump and creamy in weight. Flavors of blackberry, fig and chocolate are lightly herbal, while the finish is smooth and generous.",Chile,Carmenère,90,17.0

36282,"Like several other producers of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, Jackson Estate is trying to make a cuvée that offers something more than stereotypical tropical fruit and fresh herbs. This is a partially barrel-fermented effort that boasts brown sugar and cinnamon aromas, and flavors that mix coffee with lime and passion fruit. It's not entirely harmonious, but offers concentration and innovation, something that should be applauded.",New Zealand,Sauvignon Blanc,87,29.0
76478,"Here's a thinner style of Amarone with bright aromas of wild berry, white cherry and toasted almond. The wine is crisp and sharp on the close, with a focused, streamlined feel in the mouth.",Italy,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",88,

14608,"This is a limited production 100% Cab from the winery's estate vineyard. It's much more tannic than Cohn's extraordinarily fine '04 Estate, which was released a year ago. Even at the age of five-plus, it stings with sandpapery astringency. Should easily negotiate the years, with its massive core of blackberries, black currants, olives and 100% new oak. Hold until after 2010, and should develop for many years beyond.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,93,100.0
95492,"Quady's Right Bank blend is three-quarters Cabernet Franc and one-quarter Merlot.

78120,"One of the iconic wines of Portugal, the brand dates back to the 15th century and the Portuguese discovery of Brazil. In its latest incarnation, it is hugely dense and concentrated. It could be that it is too much, with dark extracts, yet somehow the super-ripe plum and berry flavors are given enough freshness. The structure is all there in what is still a young wine. With power and a dense texture, the wine needs to age further. Drink from 2020.",Portugal,Portuguese Red,94,275.0
54144,"A wonderfully aromatic nose of blossom and Conference pear is very appetizing. The palate comes in with pear-fruited generosity and an almost oily mouthfeel that speaks of the power of this concentrated wine. There is a pleasant edge of pithy bitterness that acts as a counterpoint to the inherent richness and ripeness of the fruit alongside fresh acidity. This is balanced and rounded and just off dry with a lovely, fresh structure that echoes long. There is great aging potential here. Drink 2017–2030.",France,Pinot Gris,93,50.0
23474,"Full, fragrant and very perfumed, this is a beautiful ripe wine that is already showing signs of maturity. Its fragrant white fruit flavors are touched by minerality and texture.

64958,"Aromas of raw oak, eucalyptus and gritty berry fruits are hot and leafy. This Tempranillo-based blend feels choppy with aggressive grating tannins. Flavors of baked roasted berry fruits are also herbal, green and leafy, while this finishes crisp, raw and tomatoey in flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend,85,80.0
1010,"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla.

28549,"Black currant fruits dominate this ripe, stalky wine that has young tannins and a smoky cedar character that comes from light wood aging. It's dry, firm and ready to drink.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85,12.0
31429,"Laser strikes of acidity and deep, mineral intensitiy lend a grounded elegance to this otherwise sunny, yielding dessert wine. It's intensely honeyed, bursting with sweet pineapple and peach flavors, yet finely filigreed in mouthfeel. Delicious already, it should improve through 2040.",Germany,Riesling,94,64.0
47283,"This hot vintage Amarone offers sweet cherry nuances with toasted nut, vanilla, red apple, resin and exotic spice. The wine is fruity and somewhat raw in the mouth and offers succulent tannins on the close.",Italy,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",87,
97122,This is a very feline wine with tight citrus and gooseberry fruits that are almost too intense for its own good.,France,Bordeaux-style White Blend,82,
128470,"Lagrein is a unique indigenous grape from northern Italy that offers plump, fruit-forward aromas and smooth richness in the mouth. This expression delivers all that within a very elegant and pristine context. Pair this wine with bean and barely soup or veal stew.",Italy,Lagrein,88,40.0
58723,"Closed and muted on the nose at first, this wine shows varietal scents that include blue and red berry fruit and dried sage. Softly textured, it's an approachable middle-of-the-road Syrah.",US,Syrah,86,35.0
18834,"Here's a big, lusty Syrah, unapologetic for its lush, ripe flavors and easy deliciousness. It's so fruity in cherries, blackberries, cola and dark chocolate, it's almost a dessert wine, except that it finishes dry.",US,Syrah,87,32.0
88325,"Tart red currant, rhubarb and strawberry come together in a very refreshing, rounded and appetizing fashion. The frothy, foaming mousse is exuberant and highlights these strawberry shortcake flavors brilliantly, while a totally dry palate makes sure that this stays classy. This is very satisfying, fun and fruit-driven, with a serious core and a bright, lemony finish.",France,Sparkling Blend,90,17.0
110065,"A soft, perfumed wine, with yellow fruits, green plums and an orange zest texture. It is pure and fresh, emphasizing acidity as well as fruit. There is a delicious, fresh character to this ready-to-drink wine.",France,Chardonnay,89,
19194,"Some years Calina makes Bravura and in others it doesn't. This is the best we've tried; it shows asphalt, black olive and tobacco aromas in addition to cassis, blackberry and cola flavors. Ripe, fairly rich and true to both the Chile and Cab blueprint. Drink now–2010.",Chile,Cabernet Blend,91,45.0
107859,"A new offering from the Sonoma-based producer meant to recall the estate's original founding in the Napa Valley, this wine sources from across that appellation and impresses right away in its succulent and soft approach to the variety. With a backbone of cassis and vanilla, it's expansive and lengthy, velvety in texture and very satisfying.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,93,50.0
41911,"The first release of this wine to carry a Yakima Valley designation, this blend of Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre and Cinsault leaps up with aromas of fresh raspberries, plum, garrigue and pepper along with light barrel accents. The elegant flavors show a striking sense of freshness and purity that keep you coming back for more.",US,Rhône-style Red Blend,90,24.0
104261,"Hints of soy and pepper color the generously ripe notions of yellow pear and red apple on the nose. The palate reinforces the spiciness with more shimmering white pepper and the ripeness with extra juiciness. This is rounded but fresh, and just so full of sunny friendly fruit. The appetizing and moreish finish returns to that initial soy-like spice.",Austria,Grüner Veltliner,93,47.0
55972,"Earthy, woody, spicy berry aromas suggest briar patch and sandalwood. This is quite clampy and tannic, and thus the mouthfeel is rough. Gritty, herbal plum and berry flavors finish with a strong sense of oak and abrasive tannins. Drink through 2021.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend,88,28.0
27005,"With just a touch of bitterness and structure, this is a finely textured wine. It has plenty of fresh red and white fruit flavors, a lively, busy mousse and a tight acidity on the finish.",France,Pinot Noir,87,14.0

19998,"Winemaker Nick Goldschmidt has turned out a Shiraz that seems a bit conflicted. It's only medium-bodied, yet packs in overripe flavors of cooked berries laced with dark chocolate and espresso. The peppery notes on the finish give it enough verve to pair with steaks or burgers.",Australia,Shiraz,87,25.0

101824,"This opens with subdued aromas of mature plum, espresso, dried herb and a whiff of forest floor. The dense rounded palate offers dried cherry, licorice, vanilla and coffee framed in velvety tannins. Drink this through 2022.",Italy,Aglianico,89,34.0
78315,"No, that's not a typo. The ??? Vineyard bottling conceals (intentionally) the fruit sources for these grapes, which come from one of Oregon's most expensive and highly-reviewed producers. It's crystal-clear in both appearance and flavor, building upon a cranberry/raspberry base into a potent young wine with expressive purity. A streak of gun metal, often found in consulting winemaker Robert Brittan's own wines, adds a stylish note to the finish.",US,Pinot Noir,94,55.0
123559,"As you might infer from the name, this tastes sweet. It appeals to consumers who enjoy the trend of sugary red wines. You could almost drink it as a dessert sipper, with its candied blackberry and cherry flavors.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,83,13.0

119882,"Inviting aromas of dark cherry, spicy bramble fruit and warm vanilla show brightly on the nose. The palate brings ripe flavors of blackcurrant and dark cherry, with mildly grippy tannins providing a solid structure. A lightly peppered note mildly lingers on the finish.",US,Cabernet Franc,88,22.0
108759,"Overall, this wine is fruity and solid. Raw, slightly austere red-fruit aromas are basic but fresh and clean. Flavors of plum, currant and cinnamon are suitable, but this wine finishes quickly.",Spain,Tempranillo,85,10.0
35382,"Beautiful richness and intensity make for a very welcoming bouquet. This 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend lasts long on the palate, and boasts luscious aromas of blackberry, Maraschino cherry, tobacco and lightly toasted hazelnut. Extrasoft, velvety tannins characterize the finish.",Italy,Red Blend,92,
51628,"From a very good if not great Champagne vintage, this mature wine is delicious and beautifully ripe. It still has plenty of crisp acidity, allowing the fruit to shine. At the same time, a yeasty, toasty character indicates its gentle aging. After eight years in the cellar before disgorging, it is ready to drink.",France,Champagne Blend,93,139.0
4788,"White flowers and peach start this slightly simple but good white from Greece. On the palate, lemon and orange flavors join with a honeyed spice. The overall character is balanced and friendly.",Greece,Moschofilero,86,14.0

12793,"A serious, intense wine, a success for the vintage, with its dusty tannins, solid blackberry fruits and a firm core. The wine is weighty, maybe just giving a green pepper hint, but generally sitting foursquare in the mouth.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90,30.0
26554,"The smokiness which on the nose melds seamlessly with red apple flavors becomes more dominant on the palate, revealing a rounded nuttiness. There is a creamy lemon freshness, too: an internationally recogniable Chardonnay style but with the purity of Austrian fruit and continental freshness.",Austria,Chardonnay,92,45.0
32648,"This is a strong, direct Chardonnay that offers no subtlety, but impresses for sheer power. It dazzles with tangerine, pineapple and peach flavors, with plenty of new oak. Ready now.",US,Chardonnay,87,28.0
116565,"Classic varietal scents of talcum powder and rosewater lead into a tangy, tart, low alcohol but bone-dry wine. The fruit is substantial, offering solid flavors of grapefruit and lemon peel.",US,Gewürztraminer,88,18.0
29564,"Fairly light and innocuous; you really have to make an effort to draw anything from the nose. The palate is sweet and sugary, especially for Pinot Gris, which should be more dry and snappy. And that sweetness carries onto the finish and all the way out the back door. Not offensive, but overly sweet and thick given the grape and origin.",US,Pinot Gris,83,14.0
88367,"The hot conditions of 2009 are draped all over this rich, syrupy wine that's opaque to the eye and heavily charred on the nose. Under a blanket of burnt oak, there's leather, beef and black-fruit aromas. The palate on this heavyweight is chewy, while flavors of oak, roasted berry and herbs lead to a mildly complex but forceful finish. This is more big and ripe than elegant.",Chile,Syrah,90,150.0
110656,"Underbrush, scorched earth, leather and camphor aromas lead the way along with an earthy whiff of game. On the ripe chewy palate, notes of crushed mint, clove, licorice and grilled porcini accent a juicy black-cherry core. Firm close-grained tannins offer taut support.",Italy,Nebbiolo,90,100.0
80101,"The color is already fading into brick around the rim, and this light Merlot is already drinking at or near its peak. It's soft and smooth, slightly nutty, with round and mature fruit flavors of cherry and berry. All in all it's a pleasant, lightly toasty wine with no rough edges.",US,Merlot,87,28.0
123267,"Here's a well balanced and easy to drink value priced Sauv Blanc, offering notes of sweet grass, barely ripe peach and melon on the nose and mouth. Perfect for summer entertaining; pair with sushi or cocktail shrimp.",South Africa,Sauvignon Blanc,85,9.0
31843,"While there is some spice here, the wine is more dominated by its acidity, fresh pear and crisp texture. It's lively, fragrant and probably best as an apéritif.",France,Pinot Gris,86,19.0
94997,"Perfumed berry, fragrant purple flower, menthol and tilled soil aromas lead the nose. The taut, rather lean palate offers dried black cherry, white pepper, leather and grilled sage accompanied by assertive, angular tannins that grip the finish.",Italy,Red Blend,88,20.0
69596,"Initially this is closed, but slowly some leesy notes appear. While some may look to Sauvignon Blanc for its usually overt aromatics, in this wine the creamy but streamlined midpalate texture is the real interest. For those who like their Sauvignons restrained and very food-friendly.",Austria,Sauvignon Blanc,91,60.0
95822,"This dry Merlot is marked by strong tannins and ripe fruit. It shows bursts of black cherry, currant, cola and cedar flavors, and it has an astringent texture that's unlikely to age away. Drink now.",US,Merlot,87,25.0

64536,"Fragrant, with a grapy appeal, this pure Gamay Noir comes on like a fresh Beaujolais. The cherry candy flavor is fruity and fun, but the wine thins out rapidly onto a quick finish.",US,Gamay Noir,85,19.0
20046,Spice and saffron notes introduce this lavishly fruity sun-kissed wine. Pristine stone-fruit and pineapple flavors are delightfully plump but balanced in sweetness and jolted by shocks of lemon-lime acidity. This is gorgeously penetrating through a long lingering finish.,Germany,Riesling,91,25.0
99341,"The defining characteristic of Carter seems to be a taste of steel or gun metal running through the spine. It's here again, with compact fruit and drying tannins. That fruit has a dark core, and it's polished and textural, with lightly herbal highlights. This is a wine to track in the cellar over the next decade or longer.",US,Pinot Noir,94,63.0
56230,"This bottling from five vineyards across the region, which also includes 18% Syrah, is dark and concentrated on the nose with aromas of plum, crushed gravel, rose petals, composting violets and gamy pepper-crusted meats. The palate is more fresh and floral, with lilac touches and kola nut spice, proving lighter weight in body and easy to quaff.",US,Grenache,91,20.0
24671,"Dijon clone again. This has just the vaguest hint of onion, but otherwise is much improved over this property's '99. There is good, juicy, crisp fruit mixing apple/apricot and light citrus. Balanced acids and a well integrated middle that leads into a somewhat hot, stiff finish. Young and edgy, but well made.",US,Chardonnay,88,35.0
85235,"High-toned baking spice, flower and herb aromas are backed by broad yet well-balanced dark-fruit flavors. The tannins are present but are polished to a fine sheen.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,52.0

89006,"While demure on the nose, this dry, seemingly diminutive Riesling builds in power and concentration on the palate. It's fairly low in alcohol, with an unassuming gradation of flavors ranging from lime to lemon and grapefruit, but its rippling textural expanse lends persistence and gravitas.",US,Riesling,90,20.0
21670,"Seems already mature, with truffle and mushroom notes creeping in among the apricot and orange marmalade fruit. Soft and lush, with just enough tannin and spice in support for near-term drinking.",France,Viognier,88,55.0
12651,An appetizing touch of red currant and cranberry plays on the nose of this vividly colored rosé. The palate is fruit-forward with subtle shades of berry and citrus. The finish is refreshing and berry-laden.,Austria,Rosé,90,18.0
23250,"Notes of dark berry, crushed flower and tobacco come together in this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Merlot. The firm palate delivers mature plum, dried cherry, coffee, licorice and toasted notes alongside a backbone of assertive tannins.",Italy,Red Blend,89,32.0
5226,"An intense bouquet of blackberry, smoked meat, flint and violet paves the way for flavors of black currant, smoked meat, coffee bean and a hint of cranberry.

Smooth, soft tannins prime the palate for the elegant finish.",Israel,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,30.0

90008,"Ripe, luscious blackberry and bramble bush notes are seductive on the nose of this rather big, powerful Cabernet Franc.

123849,"Aged for 20 months in wood, this elegant, ripe wine is finely balanced with structure and fruit. Berry flavors intermingle with dusty tannins and an acidity that suggests cool, mountain crispness. It needs to age further, so drink from 2018.",Portugal,Portuguese Red,91,20.0
2662,"As big as you expect a Howell Mountain Zin to be, offering rich, deep blackberry, currant, chocolate, licorice, bacon and cedar flavors that are sweet and dry at the same time. It's not just powerful in flavor, it's wonderful in structure, with refined tannins and balancing acidity. A minor criticism is some heat from alcohol, but that's the nature of ripe Zinfandel.",US,Zinfandel,90,45.0
62894,"Big, sturdy and extracted in blackberries, black currants and molasses, with a meaty edge, almost like a Syrah. The tannins are thick and furry and astringent, but the wine is flashy and complex. Hard now, but give it 5–6 years, and it could age well beyond that.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,85.0
114171,"Dusty, sweet, dark-fruited and properly herbal, this is a Cabernet that very much fits the Chilean blueprint of what the variety should smell and taste like.

114231,"With its onion-skin color, this already shows age. The palate, with its mature reflection and beautiful rounded texture, confirms this. Rich, well balanced and gently mature, it has retained enough red fruits to keep an element of freshness. It is a food wine, rich and full in the mouth.",France,Champagne Blend,92,75.0
99330,"This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones. Drink 2020–2030, and probably well beyond.",Australia,Cabernet Sauvignon,95,500.0
46904,"With an extra-deep color and intensely concentrated fruit and spice flavors, this wine is impressive. It has many layers of dark fruit, plus nuances of dark chocolate and baking spices like clove and nutmeg. These enhance the generous, ripe fruit that is the essence of this wine, filling the mouth and lingering on the taste buds long after each sip. It will be best after 2019.",US,Malbec,94,35.0
36195,"Even at this price, this Cab is hard to like. It's soft and somewhat vegetal, with bizarre sweet oak and cherry jam flavors.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,80,10.0

97552,"Edgy, spicy and slightly green aromas suggest bell pepper and preserved Italian red pepper. A tight mouthfeel frames herbal flavors of plum, spice and tomato that carry over to the finish. This is 60% Tannat and 40% Merlot.",Uruguay,Tannat-Merlot,86,12.0
97478,"This blend of Mourvèdre, Carignane and Syrah is still quite young but already shows lots of savory potential. Wild berry, underbrush, subtle game and crushed slate aromas lead into a palate of loaded with mulberry, sagebrush and cedar flavors. It has loads of energy out of the gate.",US,Rhône-style Red Blend,89,27.0
26798,"In contrast to a nose that's more mineral than fruit, the intensity of this wine's voluptuous nectarine and yellow peach flavors surprise. It's dry in style but with a succulent fruitiness that clings delectably to the palate. Finishes long and lean with a tang of steely minerality. Drink now through 2019.",Germany,Riesling,90,15.0

8211,"This Syrah's outstanding feature isn't the ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, cocoa and smoked meat flavors, although they are delicious. It's the balance. The tannins are lovely, the acidity is just right and the finish is spicy and complex. The wine frames the Syrah argument in California in a new way.",US,Syrah,92,48.0
62666,"Cream, vanilla, baking spice, key lime pie and tropical fruit aromas lead to a rich, flavorful palate, redolent with pineapple and kiwi flavors that hang on the clean crisp finish.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,90,20.0

35875,"Approachable with pretty cherry and rose petal flavors, this wine finds its spine via a streak of herb and tannin. Dried leaves, a hint of granite, and persistent berry flavors suggest that it can be cellared for at least 6–8 years.",US,Pinot Noir,87,43.0
76072,"This is a simple, soft and quite floral wine, showing a wealth of dusty tannin and full-bodied power. Cedar and pomegranate are the highlights that ride a textured wave of chalky oak.",US,Cabernet Franc,88,45.0

55048,"From up in the Chalone highlands, this is a fruity wine, filled up upfront flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola and spices. The structure is simple, with silky tannins and decent acids supporting the flavors without establishing any great depth or complexities.",US,Pinot Noir,85,50.0
87761,"A tight nose of black cherry and Mediterranean herbs yields to overly cooked flavors of eucalyptus, cassis and black cherry. Although cooling herb notes are a hallmark of Cabernet Sauvignon and blends from Galilee, this is a tad too cool, with eucalyptus overpowering the fruit right through the minty finish.",Israel,Red Blend,88,30.0
16891,"With 12 months in wood, this is a firm wine, with a rustic, funky character that masks the black-currant fruit. The smoky wood contrasts with the acidity while leaving a dry aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85,24.0
70630,"At first the raspberry and plum aromas are stunted and the palate seems round but basic. More airing reveals raspberry, cassis and strawberry flavors. In the end it winds up as a friendly, medium-intensity Cabernet that's good for immediate consumption.",Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,13.0
16165,This fine low-production wood-aged wine is almost Burgundian in its creamy richness. The toast is nicely judged giving a wine that has just enough acidity and has plenty of textured apple and grapefruit flavors. The wine is named after the year of the creation of the Companhia das Lezirias.,Portugal,Fernão Pires,93,77.0
73184,"Made for the first time in this vintage, this young wine is tight and brambly, with tart, peppery berry fruit. Chewy tannins denote its youth, and the finish delivers outstanding depth. If it follows the path of other Ayoub Pinots, this will benefit greatly from further bottle age.",US,Pinot Noir,93,55.0
80665,"Whiffs of herbs and green florals persist from start to finish on this elegant off-dry Riesling. The palate is lush with ripe white-peach flavor, but blossomy and bright with a streak of lemon-lime acidity. Finishes long with a delicately lacy sweetness.",US,Riesling,91,20.0
68832,"Caper berry, turned earth, blistered cherry tomato and puttanesca sauce aromas lead the nose on this top-end Pinot from Bill Foley's eponymous winery. It's wildly flavorful on the palate, offering perfectly ripe red fruit alongside woody herbs of oregano, thyme and rosemary, then leading into darkly elegant elements of black licorice, cardamom and chai spices.",US,Pinot Noir,92,60.0
68430,"This warm, rounded Champagne is full of strawberry flavors. It is ripe and soft, perhaps too soft with a suggestion of sweetness as well as the natural acidity of the wine. Drink now.",France,Champagne Blend,86,42.0

88322,"Rounded, balanced and harmonious flavors get top marks on this softly pink sparkler. Strawberries and cream, with shortbread and lemon, all unite in perfect unison.

This sparkler is classy and delicious, with an ultraclean and lasting finish.",France,Sparkling Blend,90,25.0
128187,"This wine comes from one of the grand aristocratic estates that line the eastern bank of the Tagus (Tejo) river.

9432,"A maderized color and flat, old-smelling aromas of molasses and baked beans are barely cutting it. This feels tired, with mildly oxidized flavors of raisin, tobacco and vanilla. Tomato and herbal notes carry the finish on this mostly gone Rioja.",Spain,Red Blend,82,22.0
36682,"Well rounded, subtly spicy and deep in fruit concentration, this full-bodied wine packs a lot of flavor into an almost deceptively smooth package. It has plenty of black cherry, blackberry and cocoa notes to savor and a texture that's saturated with fine-grained tannins. Best after 2018.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,91,35.0
98950,"Solid and leathery on the nose, with normal berry and plum aromas. The palate is full, round and supremely tannic, with big berry, plum and herbal flavors that culminate with more hard tannins and chocolate. A rubbery wine that hits hard.",Spain,Tinto Fino,85,20.0
18764,"Abelé has been in Champagne since the 18th century. Its nonvintage brut cuvée is an easy, fresh wine that's immediately attractive. With plenty of fruit as well as a mineral texture, it is balanced and ready to drink.",France,Champagne Blend,88,45.0
85893,"Tight and rubbery at first, but with time it settles to show jammy wild-berry aromas and density. The palate has bounce and life to spare, while the flavors are bright, fruity and full.

66938,"Named for Bob Biale's father Aldo, who maintained head-trained, dry-farmed vines planted in 1937, this red is as mighty as the man, with a length of powerful acidity.

20946,"Grilled beef, slathered in BBQ sauce, will soften and sweeten this hearty red from the Sierra Foothills. By itself, it's tannic and hard-edged. Shows rich flavors of black currants, cassis, raisins and dark chocolate.",US,Petite Sirah,84,25.0
73624,"Ripe, tannic and leathery (in a good sense), this brings concentrated flavors of cherry compôte, Campari and baking spices. It's aromatic and mouthfilling, and delivers ample pleasure.",US,Pinot Noir,92,75.0
98641,"A Sauvignon Blanc from Sardinia, and it’s a good one. One worries after the slightly reticent nose, but after that it’s all uphill. Well balanced, with crisp acidity and an expansive mouthfeel. Its predominantly melon finish goes on and on.",Italy,Sauvignon Blanc,88,12.0
124711,"Lush fruit flavors combine in a mellow mix of apple, pear and light citrus. It's a rich wine, creamy and fruit-driven, with substantial weight and length.",US,Pinot Gris,90,20.0
111523,"This wine has an overwhelmingly smoky character, like charred forest floor, along with layers of sweet vanilla in the background. Time in the cellar may allow it to meld, but for now it's meant for lovers of smoke and oak.",US,Pinot Noir,85,40.0
106321,"For this appellation, this is a soft wine, full of bright cherry flavors and attractive acidity. A jammy character brings out rich fruitiness that will allow the wine to be ready from 2018.",France,Gamay,88,14.0
16736,"This wine has aromas of cherry, cherry pie, pomegranate juice and dark chocolate. In the mouth there are flavors of cranberry, cherry cola and a touch of dried oregano. It is well balanced with soft tannins and a splash of tart cherry juice before the persistent finish.",Bulgaria,Mavrud,90,16.0
112904,"Moderately full and roundly fruity, with an undertone of mineral or concrete. This is a nicely managed blend, with the balance and grip to age for another five years.",US,Pinot Noir,87,19.0

48367,"Dark in color for a rosé, a weird orange, root beer color, and heavy in the mouth, with sugary sweet, jammy raspberry and apricot flavors.",US,Pinot Noir,82,16.0
33747,"There's a toughness to this wine that makes it a little hard to appreciate. The tannins are raw, and there's a green, herbal quality to the cherry and raspberry fruit. The oak seems to stand aside, and so does the acidity. It's all a bit ungainly now and is unlikely to improve with age, so drink up.",US,Pinot Noir,86,60.0
75665,"Another beautiful Chardonnay from this fine vineyard and winery. The wine is drier than past vintages, but rich in acidity and minerals, with a complex array of pineapple, lime and Meyer lemon citrus flavor. Fermenting half the wine in stainless steel and the balance in oak, a third of which was new, seems to be the perfect approach.",US,Chardonnay,93,45.0
94893,"This is a flavorful, easy-drinking wine with plenty of fruit aromas, a soft texture, ripeness on the palate, and medium body. It has the pastry shop suite of flavors, like vanilla, cream and even coconut, and seems a bit sweet on the finish.",US,Viognier,87,25.0
81204,"Blackberry, clove paste, wet clay and a peppery spice greet the nose in this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Primitivo and 17% Merlot.

75819,"Bold and rich, this wine has plenty of tannins to allow it to age, and equally generous ripe black-plum fruits to make it attractive now. Solid and firm, the wine is already drinkable with its juicy fruitiness, or age until 2020.",Portugal,Portuguese Red,87,25.0
109274,"Faint rose petal notes still perfume the peachy fruit. The palate is rich, medium sweet and honeyed, as though peach and citrus were soaked in honey. This is fresh and rich, rounded and poised, tipping the scales just a little bit more on the rich side. The spice on the finish is reminiscent of honeysuckle.",France,Gewürztraminer,91,33.0
129963,"A bouquet of black cherry, tart cranberry and clove opens into flavors of cherry, anisette, espresso bean and mint, with a hint of tart cranberry. The minty notes can almost seem overly strong for a moment, but tart tones bring the fruit flavors back to the foreground. The pleasantly gripping tannins will mellow with a few more years of aging.",Israel,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,20.0
48901,"Bob Betz calls this his first-ever “reserve style” wine from Bordeaux varieties. It started with a single barrel of Red Willow Cabernet Franc and evolved into this six-barrel blend. Le Parrain opens with whiffs of smoke, gun metal and rock weaving through the dense red fruits. Pipe tobacco and licorice flavors come into play from the barrel aging. As the wine slowly opens, the flavors expand and blend, and the textural quality that Betz refers to expresses itself in a graceful, three-dimensional finish.",US,Red Blend,96,85.0
115957,"Crafted from six vineyards within the Dutton family's holdings, this is a pretty wine, smooth and supple with a balance of acidity and light body. Citrus and apple vie for attention with a slight tropical note and expansiveness of ginger cookie and toffee.",US,Chardonnay,93,38.0
66278,"Very perfumed, this is a wine torn between oxidation and freshness. The aromas are nutty and smoky; when tasted, the wine is ripe and fruity, full of apricot and spice. To bring the two sides together, it should age, so drink from 2015.",France,Savagnin,88,31.0
112239,"Alluring scents of hawthorn, citrus blossom and ripe orchard fruit come together on this lovely sparkler. On the dry palate, nectarine zest and crushed herbs underscore a core of yellow apple and Bartlett pear. It's well balanced, with vibrant acidity and a creamy mousse that lends finesse.",Italy,Glera,93,35.0
61933,"Big, awkward aromas of red fruit and oak are followed by simple berry and plum flavors and even more overt oak. The finish is big and warm, while late in the game the wine turns tangy. This is one of many mass-market Merlots with few glaring faults; but still it fights to rise above basic acceptability.",Chile,Merlot,82,5.0
1174,"Toast and char sit atop the bouquet like a heavy king on his throne, but there's nothing fake or weak about it. The color is dark and the palate is round; flavors of black plum, figs and black olives convey a meaty, true personality amid all the char, chocolate and vanilla. A good wine in the massive category that is value-priced Merlot.",Argentina,Merlot,86,12.0

95158,"Quite light and restrained on the nose, this bottling from Richard and Thekla Sanford shows pithy Key lime and scratched grapefruit-skin aromas. There is a decent sizzle of acidity to the palate, with lime rinds, pith and juice playing together. Touches of almond and flint add interest.",US,Chardonnay,91,28.0
103183,"A delightful spray of cherry blossoms meanders from nose to finish in this standout Pinot Noir sparkling.

56202,"Joe Wagner's latest addition to his Copper Cane Wine & Provisions offerings is this dry brut, made from 55% Chardonnay and 45% Pinot Noir.

98410,"A creamy nose shows spikes of green freshness, reminiscent of fern or ivy. The palate holds peppery, citrusy spray with creamy generosity while white pepper and ripe pear appear at the seams.

118439,"Just like this wine has lost its initial red color, so too has its flavor changed. Now maturing fast, it conveys flavors of leather and acidity along with a dry edge that may be a sign of age. It's delicious, but drink the wine now.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87,20.0
7913,"Made with 65% Nebbiolo, 20% Vespolina and 15% Uva Rara, this polished red from Piedmont offers aromas and flavors of dried red cherry, clove, baking spice and rust. It's well balanced, with silky tannins and fresh acidity while a graphite note closes the finish.",Italy,Red Blend,90,30.0

61159,"This concentrated wine floods the mouth with flavors of cherries, blackberry jam, milk chocolate, vanilla and toast. The tannins are remarkably pure, and the finish is dry. The one issue is high alcohol, which gives the wine a chili pepper heat.",US,Syrah,87,55.0
103336,"Simple and a little vegetal, with asparagus and raspberry flavors.",US,Red Blend,81,15.0
108048,"This opens with fruity aromas of plum and black berry, alongside whiffs of tilled earth and spice. It's still a bit closed but the palate reveals black cherry, raisin and clove supported by a tannic backbone. Drink 2015–2021.",Italy,Aglianico,89,20.0

90562,"Open and fruity, this delicious, already drinkable wine is a typical Portuguese blend that's dominated by Touriga Nacional. It has an attractive perfumed aroma along with toasty wood flavors and black currant freshness. The combination is full, forward and delicious now.",Portugal,Portuguese Red,88,8.0
13184,"Produced from Malbec that comes mainly from the Cahors region, this soft, ripe and fruity wine has a light touch of tannins that show beneath the berry fruits, supple texture and tight acidity. It is ready to drink, but will be better in 2015.",France,Malbec,87,13.0
85230,"A polished, pretty Syrah. It's black in color and very soft, and tastes like a blackberry- and blueberry-infused chocolate drink, with hints of bacon. Luscious and ready to drink now.",US,Syrah,88,22.0
89283,"Plenty of ripe fruit and big texture on this intense wine, which hasn't shown half its potential yet. The pear and white peach fruits are edged with minerality and a closed-in texture. The wood gives an unfortunate burnt edge that needs to soften out. Age for at least five years.",France,Chardonnay,93,
33818,"The black label Torii Mor Pinot is the entry-level wine, clean and fresh with clear varietal character. The fruit flavors are tart and lean, but combined with the bouquet offer elegant details with herb and earthy components. The alcohol is a sensible 13.8% and as the wine breathes open it suggests lightly smoked ham and hints of pepper.",US,Pinot Noir,88,29.0
91738,"Dusty mineral and herbal aromas contrast against a palate that's chock full of raspberry and cherry flavor. It's forward with fruit, but a bit strikingly acidic, spiked by a razor-like edge of cranberry and lemon.",US,Rosé,86,16.0
48449,"Stainless-steel fermented and aged in neutral oak, this wine threads the line between grassy wet stone and fresh-squeezed grapefruit, offering dry refreshing acidity. Light bodied, it provides just enough oomph to hold its own at the table.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,88,25.0
61903,"Palmaz has struggled to break into the top ranks, and this 2006 does not advance their cause. It smells funky and vegetal, although it turns fairly rich in the mouth, with cherries, red licorice, cocoa and cedar. Doesn't seem likely to improve over time.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,100.0
33302,"Powerful in wildflower-accented white and yellow fruits that have a baked, pie-filling flavor, this Roussanne has the weight and creamy texture of a Chardonnay. It turns spicy and a little tart on the finish, making it a disappointment after the fine 2005.",US,Roussanne,85,20.0
123972,"This lovely sparkling wine has aromas of white peach and bread crust. The palate delivers creamy peach and apricot flavors, along with notes of toasted almond. Crisp, quenching acidity makes for a clean finish.",Italy,Chardonnay,89,30.0
120117,"This dry white wine opens with aromas of acacia flower, honey and stone fruit. The lack of sweetness holds back some of the aromatic intensity, and the wine is easy, fresh and zesty on the finish. Pair it with fried cocktail shrimp.",Italy,Moscato,85,15.0
91101,"A laser-focused nose of lime zest, limestone and a hint of orange blossom characterize this very refreshing sparkler. The bubbles dance across the tongue with lean, not lush flavors of orange peel and squeezed citrus.",US,Sparkling Blend,91,30.0
79578,"Touches of dill, cherry, rose and cassis compose this wine's soft-spoken nose. On entrance, it pops with a dark fruit flavor, but loses some steam on the midpalate. Minimal tannic traction lends a slick texture, while the uplifting acids make the palate glow.",US,Sangiovese,84,21.0
77113,"Agostina Pieri opens with notes of old leather and animal tones that eventually blow off to reveal cured ham and smoked bacon. This is a big, broad expression of Sangiovese with tart cherry flavors and slightly astringent tannins. You might want to give it a few more years of aging to mellow out but whether the aromas will hold over time is uncertain.",Italy,Sangiovese Grosso,87,55.0
10825,This blend of Gamay and Pinot Noir is soft and ripe with red fruits. The wine is all fruit: red cherry and raspberry with a light touch of spice and tannins. The wine is ready to drink.,France,Pinot Noir-Gamay,85,15.0

4501,"Winemaker: Bernhard Veller. This is a surprisingly concentrated and wood-dominated Sauvignon Blanc, with initial aromas of yellow melon, grilled peach, cedar plank, orange cream and baking spice. It's full and round on the palate, with a smooth, somewhat flabby texture and forward oak flavors that overwhelm the fruit character.",South Africa,Sauvignon Blanc,89,
5412,"Stout up front, the nose is packed with black-fruit aromas. The palate feels a bit prickly and raw, while blackberry flavors run quick, with a chocolaty oak character popping up on a lean finish.",Argentina,Malbec,88,17.0
9329,"In this fruit-forward vintage, it's not surprising to find that what shines here are the bright, spicy and tart flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries. The Sangiovese was co-fermented with 7% Syrah, and aged in 30% new American oak. As the wine breathes open the flavors of oak and char come up, and the tannins show some extra grip.",US,Sangiovese,89,24.0
6018,"This is a powerhouse of a wine, from a tremendous coastal site, situated within a blanket of forest at 1,200-feet elevation. Reductive notes of diesel oak give way to juicy, stemmy and grippy characteristics, marked most pronounced by flavors of black cherry, raspberry and black tea.",US,Pinot Noir,90,75.0

72589,"At first glance it may seem a little saucy, but as it gains its legs this aged Yecla wine shows solid plum, berry and cassis aromas and flavors along with a lively, healthy palate.

A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, Imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Red Blend,89,
34399,"Berries are the name of the game in this rich, forward Syrah. Cherries, raspberries, mulberries and spicier, gamier kinds of wild berries mark the flavors, which are lifted by sweet, smoky oak. The mouthfeel is pure and velvety, courtesy of ripely soft tannins. A fashionable wine to drink now, especially with lamb.",US,Syrah,91,49.0
55049,"The cherry and cinnamon aromas are true and inviting, and they stand up to the oak that's been thrown at this Pinot. The flavor profile deals raspberry and cherry amid oaky shadings.

101346,"A more somber garnet color than some other sparkling Shirazes, with seemingly lower pressure and a more vinous character. Vanilla, leather and cherry notes finish close to dry. A very good, inexpensive introduction to the genre.",Australia,Shiraz,87,13.0
119828,"Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this salmon-colored sparkler has delicate aromas of McIntosh apple, citrus zest and a whiff of honey. The bright palate offers strawberry, bread crust and a note of toasted hazelnut alongside an elegant mousse.",Italy,Pinot Nero,88,30.0
112494,"Ripe and soft on the nose, this blend of Monastrell, Garnacha and Syrah is so easygoing that it lacks pop up front. Plump and fruity on the palate, this is low on structure and acidity. Jammy raspberry and strawberry flavors end in friendly fashion, but with low definition. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend,88,32.0
106899,"This juicy, savory Rosso opens with a pretty fragrance of crushed violets, perfumed berries and sweet cake spices.

Bright orange fruit sensations signal the close.",Italy,Sangiovese,92,27.0
106716,"Aromatics of raisin and earthy tobacco breathe complexities as this airs out. A balanced but ripe and mouthfilling palate holds deep flavors of blackberry and cassis. Loamy berry, fig and chocolate flavors provide pleasure on the finish. Drink through 2018.",Argentina,Malbec,90,22.0
125568,"Ripe loamy black-fruit aromas are attractive on their own and benefit from an elegant note of balsam wood. Energetic and balanced in feel, this Malbec tastes of savory meaty black fruits.

125630,"Sobon's dry rosé (made from 96% Grenache grapes and 4% Syrah) is pinkish-red in color, brisk and structured with acidity, and a great, great value to boot. Drink on its own—plenty chilled—or find some fresh seafood and enjoy.",US,Rosé,86,11.0

13446,"This has a gorgeous nose redolent with dried spices and hints of incense. The moderate (13.8%) alcohol is a joy, and the use of oak (half new) is just right.

111343,"Syrah dominates the blend on this dry, complex red wine. It brings tannins and deep flavors of blackberries and charred meat.

It's a polished and complex wine that brings to mind a perfect steak.",US,Rhône-style Red Blend,91,48.0

16452,"A very seductive nose of baked apple and even apple juice is tempered by a peppery, greenish spiciness. The palate shows even more of that pepper but makes the full-fruited nature of this Austrian native (not related to Grüner) a very moreish, lightbodied but richly textured wine with ample freshness. A very friendly style.",Austria,Roter Veltliner,89,54.0
110487,"Trinity's first-ever reserve is a beauty; half the barrels were new French oak, half neutral.

It offers exceptional value for the price.",US,Pinot Noir,93,45.0
77388,"Slight smoke and dark plum, a hint of polished mahogany and the merest touch of leather suggest restrained elegance and complexity. The palate is just medium-bodied but of such subtle balance that the entire wine becomes utterly seductive even though heat is palpable. There are dark, brooding elements of fruit that play above the taut, grippy but fine structure. What a distinguished, beautiful rendition of Merlot.",Austria,Merlot,94,44.0
87245,"This is Terlato's ambitious entry into the cult Cabernet lottery. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, it's an elaborate wine, deep and long in blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha and sandalwood flavors. The tannins are impressive, yet young, giving a tough, astringent mouthfeel. But ageability is brought into question by some superripeness, in the form of raisins.",US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90,175.0

76292,"This wine has rich, almost sweet fruit aromas and vivid fruit flavors generously accented by clove, cinnamon and other spicy oak influences.

45671,"Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope.

Lovely anise accents the crisp fruit, providing a worthy example of the appellation and clean winemaking coming together in an elegant way.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,94,50.0
107778,"A new bottling from the winery. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, a cool area south of the Russian River Valley, toward San Francisco. The vintage was cool, too, so the wine is brisk in acidity and low in alcohol, but it still tastes amazingly ripe and complex. The wine dazzles with waves of black raspberry jam, sweet olive tapenade, sautéed brown mushroom, root beer, moo-shu plum sauce and mocha. If those flavors sound like they don't go together, just try the wine. It's seamless and compelling. Drink now–2020.",US,Pinot Noir,96,55.0
28637,"The new release from this old (1972) vineyard boosts the alcohol to 13.9%, dropping the residual sugar to just over 1%. Deep, concentrated, and driven by a dense minerality, this exceptional single-vineyard Riesling has raw fruit flavors of green apple, white peach and citrus rind. Sure to evolve, perhaps over decades, it has the vivid acidity and penetrating finish to improve significantly.",US,Riesling,93,22.0

It is definitely worth your attention.",Italy,Syrah,92,110.0

50266,"The two grapes in this blend create a finely structured wine full of tannins that give shape and density to its young fruit.

114843,"Bold and pruney, with herbal, soft, ultraripe aromas in front of a jumpy yet partially stewed palate. This blend of Malbec with Bonarda and Syrah is your typical huge, tannic bruiser with big extract, huge tannins and just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Pretty good and perfectly drinkable, but a little over the edge.",Argentina,Red Blend,87,40.0

57117,The sumptuousness of the nose belies the 2014 vintage: this is Zweigelt made plummy and elegant to render it like velvet.

6090,"A majority Cabernet Sauvignon, with 15% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc, this wine traffics in huge upfront tannins, accented by clove and dried herb. The power relents on the finish, ending soft.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,48.0
92727,"Goldschmidt released their 2004 Vyborny Cab nearly 2 years ago, and it was terrific. This PLUS bottling has not been explained by the winery, but seems to be a reserve-style selection of the wine, and a lot oakier. The wine is extremely ripe in blackberries and cherries, while the oak adds sweeter vanilla and caramel flavors that do not really add to the original release.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,91,120.0
11461,"Seafood platters loaded with steamed mussels and spicy crab cakes call out for a fresh, vibrant Vernaccia just like this bottling. Massimo Daldin offers touches of vanilla cream, yellow fruits and nuts, which give it momentum and character.",Italy,Vernaccia,87,16.0
111252,"There's a barnyardy funkiness to this Pinot Noir that is frankly fascinating.

112667,"Sweet and viscous, this ratchets up the level of sugar and concentration beyond that of Weil's 2009 auslesen. Dried apricots rule, but nuances of musky spice and candied pineapple play supporting roles.

It combines quite ripe Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Cabernet Franc, 15% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot, projecting power and prestige with perfumed violet, dark cherry and savory leather and tobacco notes.

31284,"The appetizing perfume is a perfect fusion of lemon zest and tart apple. The palate also pitches that same, ripe freshness against zingy tang.

A super-clean finish.",Austria,Riesling,93,29.0
111871,"Yellow-ish in color, heavy on the nose, more oily than in the past, and with an aroma of cheap perfume.

44081,"Tight and dry in tannins now, with an astringent mouthfeel that feels like sandpaper. So is it an ager? It's dry and balanced and rich in blackberries, cherries and currants, so it might be. Try after 2012, if you're the gambling type.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,48.0
9998,"It's interesting and a little odd that this 100% Sauvignon Blanc, from Mondavi's heralded To Kalon's great I Block, already is showing signs of maturity, although it's only about three years old. The reserve To Kalon, released more than a year ago, was fresh and fruity. This wine by contrast is beginning to show mushroom, herb and mineral complexities alongside the citrus fruits. It's a very fine wine, superior in structural integrity and bone dry, but it will separate wine lovers into opposing camps.",US,Fumé Blanc,91,75.0

13188,"Modest apple and citrus aromas are clean and pleasant, and the same can be said of the flavors, which add hints of melon to the mix.

Let's hope it's a positive indicator for the future.",France,Rhône-style White Blend,87,16.0

94928,"Zippy and fresh, this wine also offers deeper layers of papaya and guava that provide a confectionery complement to the fruit.

93592,"Most Vista Hills Pinots see only neutral oak, as is the case here. The emphasis is on high acid and clean red-fruit flavors. It's simple and fresh, but it seems as if a touch of new oak wouldn't hurt a bit.",US,Pinot Noir,87,44.0
13445,"As in 2003 this is a blend of Stillwater Creek and Sundance Vineyard fruit. Some complex aromas of cured meat and smoke are added to an underpinning of berry and currant fruit.

Retasted 24 hours after being opened, the wine had blossomed into full-blown flavor.",US,Syrah,90,20.0
94360,"This is quite a change from the winery's previous vintage, with the alcohol reaching a hefty 15% and the new oak aging now at 50% new for 21 months. The result is astringent and earthy, a little sweaty and leathery, with drying tannins.",US,Malbec,85,28.0

122236,"Scorched earth, game, cured meat and leather waft out of the glass. The taught palate offers dried black cherry, pomegranate roasted coffee bean, anise and a vanilla note but not quite enough fruit richness. Tightly wound, grainy tannins leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink.",Italy,Sangiovese,88,

129840,"The entry is oaky and the fruit light; it seems a bit unbalanced.

93718,"Pretty tight and closed down in its youth, this mountain Pinot shows tannins unusual in California versions of the variety. Totally dry, it has a deep core of blackberries, currants, wild berries and chocolate. Will probably develop, but it's a bit too full-bodied for a Pinot Noir.",US,Pinot Noir,87,30.0

11087,"This wine is still young and precocious, but don't judge it too quickly. Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar.

97699,"A touch of wood helps the wine's light fruit to deepen and become richer. The wine is well balanced, with fresh acidity giving a good lift.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85,15.0
39306,"Rich, ripe and concentrated, the lush array of black fruits is enhanced with a generous amount of barrel-generated baking spices. There's a chef's pantry of cinnamon, ginger and more, along with a vein of molasses and a whiff of coffee running through the tannins. It's a total yum-fest.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,94,30.0
80147,"Saturated raisiny aromas include notes of clove and nutmeg. This is huge and also tartaric in feel. Baked raisiny flavors are chocolaty, while savory, leathery notes add complexity to a hard, tannic finish.",Argentina,Malbec,88,35.0
32800,"Always an eye-opening bottling, this blends 50% Sangiovese with 50% Syrah. This vintage shows cooked blackberries, baked plums, balsamic vinaigrette and black rocks on the nose.

76921,"This Cab shows how ripe the Happy Canyon area can get grapes even in a cool vintage. The wine brims with red cherry, currant and licorice flavors that are, in a word, delicious. It's adequate in acidity, but is a little candied. Drink now.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,54.0
58358,"This is a pinnacle of the modern style of winemaking in Napa Valley. The tannins are strong but not aggressive. The acidity is just enough to provide balance for the tremendously rich blackberry, black currant, Kahlua and olive flavors. The oak is powerful, but the wine wears it easily. The finish is thoroughly dry, long and spicy. And although the alcohol is high, it's not impossible. You can drink it now, although the tannins could benefit from 6–8 years in the cellar.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,96,275.0
41632,"A clean, crisply elegant Sauvignon Blanc. Shows a fancy structure of tart acidity framing dry, mouthwatering flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, lemongrass, figs and vanilla. Very pretty and polished.",US,Fumé Blanc,89,24.0
64560,"Merlot has long been Waterbrook's strong suit, and this offers the expected seamless blend of cherry/berry fruit, softly polished tannins and toasty barrel flavors. What are missing—at least for the moment—are the grace notes. Give it plenty of breathing time and you begin to detect traces of spice and earth, finishing with a lick of chocolate.",US,Merlot,87,22.0
125776,"An exceptional wine. Fragrant, with plenty of plum, black cherry, cedar and spice aromas. On the palate, it's silky smooth, elegant and fresh, yet packed with complex layers of blackberry, cassis, chocolate, coffee, anise, sage, thyme and cherry flavors.

109918,"This wine is supremely pretty, inviting in rose petals and violets. Sourced from Oakville Ranch Vineyard and Vineyard Georges III in Rutherford, it deserves its own bottling.

28597,"Mildly pickled red-fruit aromas fail to convey freshness or ripeness, and so it's no surprise that the core flavors are a bit herbal and briney. Decent mouthfeel helps it along, while the finish is short and borders on medicinal.",Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon,83,12.0
110854,"This small-production wine features light but potent aromas of lychee, orange, honey, wild flowers and spice.

Razor-edged acidity keeps all the fruitiness in balance, finishing bright and brisk.",Germany,Riesling,90,28.0
46983,"This wine's oak and butterscotch aromas follow through to the lean palate, along with hints of toasted nut. Although linear and focused, it doesn't have enough fruit richness to stand up to the evident oak.",Italy,Pinot Grigio,86,35.0

94115,"Dal Forno delivers one of the world's most impossibly rich and concentrated red wines. Using grapes sourced from the high-density Monte Lodoletta vineyard, this inky, dark expression oozes with syrupy tones of maraschino, dark chocolate fudge, cinnamon spice, crushed clove and barbecue smoke. In keeping with the wine's legendary reputation for long aging potential, the tannins are rock solid at the moment.",Italy,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",95,530.0
88821,"Forward, ripe and full bodied, this most pleasurable Pinot Gris is drinking quite well, with fresh fruit flavors of pear and melon. Moderate acidity is just sufficient to keep the fruit from becoming too flabby. The wine was vinted and bottled by Lujon.",US,Pinot Gris,88,20.0

Classic Sonoma Coast Pinot, with brisk acidity and complex flavors, it shows wild raspberry, cherry and blueberry fruits, persimmons, cola, and earthier notes of sautéed wild mushrooms and truffles.

105296,"Creamy and rooty at first, and then smokier and darker as it settles. For young Malbec it displays both a jammy fruit side and an acidic center. So there's both ripeness and heft but also a piercing sizzle. Perfectly good for parties and less-serious imbibing.",Argentina,Malbec,85,11.0
39207,"Owned by the Castel family, this chateau regularly produces attractive wines. This year, the wine is rich and still with its layers of dominant wood flavors.

Concentration and layering raise it way above average.",US,Pinot Noir,93,59.0
38624,"Opens with spice notes of cinnamon and anise before transitioning to fuller cherry and plum flavors. The mouthfeel is warm and fatty, while the finish still holds some buttery notes and tannic grip. Nothing spectacular but not bad for a 1999 wine from Valdepeñas.",Spain,Tempranillo,84,13.0

67716,"Far and away the best yet from this five-year-old site, Syncline's 2009 GV is a remarkable wine. While retaining clear varietal character—light pepper, green herb, and a floral/citrus palate—it brings the vivid brightness of Washington fruit into play, along with a searing acidity and surprising body.

105550,"Friendly, fresh ripe apples beckon on the nose. The pure and fruit-driven palate follows suit, presenting flavors of juicy, ripe apples. A smidgen of residual sugar boosts these delicious fruit flavors and turns up the volume on ease and joy but Riesling's vibrant freshness counters this masterfully so the finish is just off dry. This is lovely, bouncy and full of joy. Drink 2017–2022.",France,Riesling,92,

83411,"Zesty and lean, this exquisitely fine-framed Riesling builds in intensity. It's mineral and spry from start to finish, but juicy-sweet tangerine and honey notes add brightness and sunshine to the midpalate. It's enjoyable now, but likely to intensify through 2025.",Germany,Riesling,91,36.0
22512,"Opening scents of cherry blossoms, fresh-picked cherries, and a dusting of powdered chocolate beckon further exploration.

253,"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit.

31366,"The high score reflects the wine's potential, because it has been put on the market before it's ready to be opened. Fresh and zippy in acidity, its flavors are of raspberry and cherry pie filling, while sweet, caramelized oak has not yet been integrated. Cellar it for a year or two, even longer.

37648,"This is a new single-vineyard bottling for Goldeneye, grown in the cooler Deep End western part of the valley. It's a feral kind of Pinot. Not for it the tame fruit of warmer climates.

62581,"Pungent oily, tropical aromas of pineapple and melon come with a distant shot of turpentine and/or chemical cleanser. In the mouth, this is round and melony, with solid framing. Citrus and lychee flavors finish with a light coating of bitter pith. Drink right away.",Argentina,Torrontés,86,15.0
90356,"This could be labeled Merlot, which comprises three-quarters of the Bordeaux-style blend.

92677,"This wine from a Loire Valley clone is light in the glass and reductive at first, showing dried grass and sour green apple skin scents on the nose.

When people talk about fine cool-climate Chilean SB, this is what they should be referencing.",Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,91,30.0
120173,"A bit heavy and granular on the nose, with oily aromas that raise question marks. Fortunately, the wine mostly tastes true, with apple-based lead flavors followed by some pithy bitterness.

13101,"Smoke, toast, mesquite and barbecue tones emerge from the nose of this nicely concentrated Barbaresco from La Spinona.

115809,"If you like the Australian Rieslings, which often push petrol, mineral and shy fruit, than this is for you.

A potential by-the-glass favorite.",Chile,Riesling,87,10.0
16139,"The brisk acidity and tough tannins suggest cellaring this Pinot Noir for a while. To judge by the core of cherries and red currants, it should ride out the years effortlessly.

48755,"This tiny-production wine shows an attention to detail in the vineyard and cellar.

84825,"Tasted with over a decade of bottle aging, this late-release Spätlese is a heart-stopper. The core of this delicately honeyed wine is still vibrantly fruity, concentrated in luscious yellow peach and cherry flavors.

It should maintain its spry, electric feel from now through 2021 at least.",Germany,Riesling,95,45.0

119658,"One of the world's best PX wines is Solera 1927, the pride of Alvear. Whatever solera stocks went into this bottling were well selected. Aromas of maple and fine wood turn to fig and caramel.

Drink or hold.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez,96,30.0

103120,"Hard to describe the balance and elegance of this Cabernet Franc, although it's pretty hard in tannins. Below that is a fabulous core of blackberry, black cherry and mineral flavors.

87177,"Very smooth and flavorful, this full-bodied wine pairs excellent concentration of dark-fruit flavors with subtle accents of both dark and milk chocolate.

20069,"The attack on this light-bodied sipper is unabashedly fruity, with loads of ripe peach and nectarine flavors. It balances out quite nicely with zippy acidity and a dry, steely finish.

48386,"Full-bodied and delicious, this opens with aromas of red berry, rose, underbrush, kitchen spice and a balsamic note.

44164,"Fairly tannic, this lovely Pinot Noir has a dusty, dry astringency that tamps down the palate's enjoyment of the fruit, and suggests aging.

56452,"Those familiar with Morgan's more expensive Chardonnays, such as the Double L (which comprises 55% of this blend) will find true value in this regional wine.

Drink 2018 onward.",US,Pinot Noir,93,50.0
33122,"A bit stalky to begin with; there's tobacco, herbs and generic berry aromas that turn raisiny upon airing. The palate is definitely on the raisiny side, and thus it's sweet, a bit flat and ultimately tastes and feels slightly overripe.",Argentina,Malbec,84,11.0

1574,"A huge Cabernet, in the best sense of the word. It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,96,125.0
23476,"With its memorable squat bottle, this is a classic 20-year old tawny. It retains memories of fruitiness but is focused on concentrated acidity, dried-fruit flavors and textural richness. Drink now, but it can be kept for a few weeks after opening.",Portugal,Port,91,
8570,"The nose just gives a gentle hint of ripe apricot. The palate, on the other hand, speaks freely of zesty citrus: ripe lemon and fresh Seville orange, full of tart zestiness and refreshing zing.

52463,"Here's a pretty Brunello that shows interesting complexity and bright aromas that really distinguish this wine from other 2008s. The aromas lean toward herbal and menthol tones, with accents of cola and black licorice. There's more fruit in the mouth, especially cherry, with crisp freshness too.",Italy,Sangiovese Grosso,91,
114296,"Usually Natura is better than this; this hot-vintage wine shows animal notes, spice and jumpy plum and cherry aromas. It's edgy and raw in feel, with hollow, green-leaning flavors and minty oak. An echo of green rattles across the finish.",Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,83,11.0
105177,"A fine vintage, which shows some age from a relatively fast-maturing year, but is now nicely poised between the initial fresh green fruits and grapefruit flavors, and the elements of toast and yeast that are developing well. This is a great food wine, with some weight and ripeness.",France,Champagne Blend,93,80.0
78439,"Roughly half Cabernet Sauvignon, one-fourth Cab Franc and the rest a blend of Merlot and Malbec, the 2007 Old Olive Block shows crisp plum fruit with chocolate and cedar overtones. Soft, dusty tannins fade gracefully on the finish. Drink now–2017.",New Zealand,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89,

54500,"The Côte des Bar is the source of grapes for this Aube-based producer, now in the family's eighth generation.

Drink now.",France,Champagne Blend,90,56.0
49834,"Here's an earthy, dark red with soft tannins that's perfectly approachable now. Menthol, blackberries, cassis and leathery spice fill the nose and mouth, with moderate weight and a medium finish. A nice choice for grilled or herb-crusted lamb chops.",South Africa,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,86,10.0
3110,"A lot of olive and herbs upfront, with cumin and other exotic, arguably unusual aromas. The palate is soft and a little low on structure, but the flavors are big and sweet, almost overripe and syrupy. There's cola, blackberry, coffee and mulchy herbal flavors from start to finish. A big wine that needs to be drunk now; it's not going to get better.",Chile,Carmenère,88,49.0

127797,"Strange aromas of chewing gum, silly putty, green beans and turnip make for an unconventional bouquet. The palate is rather vegetal and dilute, with hints of sweet gum and pepper.

36245,"A fascinatingly flavorful wine by South African Ernst Storm, this shows very perfumed apple peels, pungent green pears and telltale grass shavings on the nose, all lifted by white pepper, wet thyme and hints of dried peaches.

47372,"Drew is single-handedly making a case for the tiny Mendocino Ridge appellation and its ability to nurture intense Syrah with this perfumed wine explosive in black pepper and cherry. Its fine, softly-hewed tannins keep things fresh and sinewy. Complex and dancing in acidity, this Syrah cries out for charcuterie, especially artisan salami, its perfect match in pepper.",US,Syrah,93,40.0

118589,"An inky-black, syrupy-thick wine from 60-year-old head-trained vines, this fills the palate with a taste of blueberry cobbler aside a slab of bacon, a mix of both savory and sweet.

59558,"Named after the outcropping of gravel on which the vines are planted, this second wine of Fourcas-Dupré is Merlot-based.

85375,"Here's a sweet-smelling, very vanilla-based Riserva that has evidently benefited from a sophisticated oak aging regimen to shape a round, soft, modern wine.

46869,"Black cherry, cassis and cola aromas are on the money and exact, with nothing overt sticking out. This bottling is strongly built, probably the most tannic of Atauta's 2010 single-vineyard wines, but it's not coarse.

The flavors are delicate and refreshing at first on the brisk palate, and then they warm up pleasantly into marcona almond and a bit of butter.",US,Chardonnay,89,23.0
72275,"Though labeled Sauvignon Blanc, this includes 20% Muscat, which makes it more of a proprietary white wine than a pure varietal expression. The flavors combine grassy, salad greens with citrus and grapefruit rind. The Muscat shows up in the orange blossom highlights. As the low alcohol would suggest, this dry wine has plenty of natural acidity.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,88,18.0

67132,"Concentrated oak aromas and flavors are the hallmarks of this medium-bodied, full-flavored and attractively priced wine.

119912,"Made by Ross Cobb and Katy Wilson, a rockstar winemaking team, this Pinot is earthy and spicy, a light, softly textured example of the complexity and nuance possible out of the cooler sites of the Sonoma Coast.

42019,"Generally considered the best of the best single vineyard Pinots from Sineann, this new Resonance is—to quote the late, great Robert Palmer—simply irresistible.

None of this is overwhelming; the fruit rules. But the finesse and length, which sneaks up on you, are impressive.",US,Pinot Noir,94,48.0

39697,"Bical is the native grape of Bairrada and this wood-aged version has some of the steely, tight character that is typical of the variety. It also has a good toasty flavor, touches of ripe apple and spice. Drink now, although the wine can age.",Portugal,Bical,87,28.0
108940,"Floral aromas of violet, carnation and rose water open the bouquet of this wine, framing the core of muddled black berries and cherries. The texture is tighter and more restrained than anticipated, with astringent tannins and prominent acidity lending a young, firm impression to the palate. Notes of leather and bramble carry the medium-length finish. Try after 2016.",South Africa,Pinotage,88,38.0
123451,"As sweet as a dessert wine, with simple pineapple jam flavors.",US,Chardonnay,82,9.0

14110,"Piled high with tannins, José Perdigão's dark, firm wine is structured and rich. A blend of 35% each of Tinta Roriz and Jaen, 20% Touriga Nacional and 10% Alfrocheiro enmeshed in new French barrels for 12 months, it shows black plum, dark chocolate and spice tones alongside bright acidity. It is still working its way through the dry core of tannins and will certainly be better to drink from 2019.",Portugal,Portuguese Red,92,40.0
17523,"Interesting to see that Washington State vineyards can ripen Sangio in a wide range of microclimates; this is true to the variety with tart acids, sharp flavors of berry, hints of pumpkin pie spice and tobacco, and just enough butterscotch barrel notes to fill in around the rough edges. This is good winemaking, with a tough grape.",US,Sangiovese,89,26.0
126506,"Young and vigorous now, marked by tannins and dryness that mask the fruit, making the wine somewhat aloof. However, the fruit is huge.

34092,"A 30-year-old tawny that shows great intensity and rich dried fruits and honey as well as the woody flavors from long aging in barrel.

107397,"Cass has been focusing on Bordeaux reds in Paso Robles; their Cab Franc has been very good, and this Cabernet Sauvignon is better.

36074,"Shows the firm tannins and full-bodied richness of Petite Sirah, but it's not an ager because it's a little too low in acid for the long haul. So enjoy it now for the wealth of blackberries, cherries, anise and mocha.",US,Petite Sirah,89,26.0

44914,"Chunky, meaty, saucy plum and berry aromas are green and gritty. This is solid feeling on first blush, but then it collapses and turns clampy and tannic. Minimal berry and cassis flavors battle with herbal, green notes in front of a chubby, imprecise finish.",Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,85,16.0

75070,"This high-toned bruiser pushes ultraripe scents of figs and raisins and prunes to the front, yet shows a green streak in the tannins. The wine spent 34 months in barrel, which adds more heavy-duty accents but does not mask the underlying stemminess.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,85,45.0
9120,"Initially a bit closed, this opens with aromas of leather, leafy underbrush, tilled soil, wild berry and a whiff of cellar floor. The palate is still primary, displaying red cherry, sage and menthol alongside tightly knit tannins. Drink after 2018.",Italy,Nebbiolo,90,68.0
122035,"Everything about this wine screams for aging. It's tight in acids and tannins, and the fruitiness tastes young and jammy with waves of raspberries, cherries, red currants and mocha.

63211,"This late-released bottling is incredibly interesting.

It should continue to develop in the bottle for a few more years.",US,Chardonnay,93,45.0
23570,"Unless you knew that this was Dominus and had tasted older vintages, you might not be impressed. In its youth the wine is tannic and dry and linear.

Flavors convey purity and concentration, with the tannins providing a lightly chalky feel.",US,Sangiovese,91,25.0
27540,"Just a bit mulchy on the nose, which signals that is a wine from the hot 2003 vintage. The palate sits on raisin and mocha, and there's even a creamy, thick feel to it.

30193,"Brambly berries, plum and sweet-spice aromas lead on the bouquet of this wine, with secondary hints of tree bark and licorice root.

129131,"Rich doesn't begin to describe this Chard. It's humongous in pie-filling and grilled peaches, pears, pineapples and papayas, while 50% new oak adds all sorts of buttercream, crème brûlée and smoked butter layers. Yet the wine shows a minerality that grounds and balances it. Very fancy stuff, and should age for up to six years.",US,Chardonnay,93,50.0

The palate impression is still young, firm and tight, with tart loganberry fruit that has a nice tang to it.

27860,"This bold and flavorful wine has a strong black-tea element in the complex flavors, full body and a smooth, mouthcoating texture.

77011,"Like Bricco delle Viole, Barolo Albe also has a slightly thorny, nervous character but ultimately this wine is softer and more approachable than the latter.

120019,"A selection of the best lots of wine from the 2011 vintage, this is a blend of Aragonez and Alicante Bouschet.

46744,"Aggressive tannins and an unusually strong herbal component make this new vintage of Feather a bit difficult to assess at this moment.

37649,"Clos Apalta continues to push the envelope for Chilean icon wines. It's always been a blend of four or five Bordeaux grapes, and the 2005 is every bit as structured, tight and ripe as any predecessor. There is an intense blanket of new oak that tastes of mint, cinnamon, sawdust and black licorice. When that subsides (maybe in another 12 months), expect racy and complex berry flavors, pinpoint tannins and preserving acidity. Hold for another two years; then drink through 2014.",Chile,Red Blend,94,75.0

121964,"Crafted by Billo Naravane from Rasa Vineyards, this is Echo Ridge's sole blend—a mix of 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cab Franc and 17% Merlot—all from the estate vineyard in eastern Oregon.

74819,"Mostly Cabernet with 305 Sangiovese, Camartina is a thick, solid, streamlined wine that shows the highest level of winemaking expertise.

121702,"This is a ripe rounded wine, backed by the firm tannins that mark Pommard. It is bold, ripe with plenty of concentrated red fruits and finishing acidity. The wine has a crisp edge that lifts the tannins. Drink from 2023.",France,Pinot Noir,93,94.0
47359,"Made by Angelo Gaja at his estate in coastal Tuscany, this blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc leads with aromas of plum, spice and warm toasted notes.

32861,"Merlot gives this wine a broad and flavorful midpalate of mixed berry and currant and cherry fruit; it's got plenty of acid below and tannin behind, and it lays out beautifully across the palate. The finishing tannins are lightly earthy, lightly chocolaty, and suggest pencil shavings and a splash of anise as well. Excellent value.",US,Merlot,89,19.0

56778,"Made in the richly extracted, super-oaky and sweetly soft style of modern Napa Cabs, this wine trades structure for sheer deliciousness. The flavors are wildly extravagant: blackberries, blueberries, cherries, pie crust, cola, exotic spices, smoke, graphite.

124481,"Though bearing the Willamette Valley label, this is principally Pommard clone fruit from Northridge vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA.

127892,"This is a wine on the cusp of being mature. The red-berry flavors are dissipating into a secondary aromatic character.

95563,"The H3 Cab comes across as a more tightly defined, sharp-edged version of the Merlot. Same berry flavors, a bit more acid, and a sense that the wine goes deeper into the palate, though with less breadth. It feels taut in the middle, as if needing more bottle age and/or breathing time to flesh out, but the structure is sound and the flavors clean and varietal.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,15.0

5150,"Two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other Bordeaux grapes filling in the rest. Though this 2006 vintage was held back for some time to allow for extra bottle age, this is still a hard, tannic wine that requires decanting. The build-out is well done, tannins firm and moderately ripe, fruit flavors Bordeaux-like. Right now it's a bit monolithic, tasty enough, but without the textural interest that most Abacela wines display.",US,Claret,87,32.0

37444,"Supple and juicy, this young, purple, berry-loaded Cab includes small amounts of the other four Bordeaux grapes in the blend. It's a masterful blending achievement, with each grape seeming to contribute something to the nose, the mouthfeel, the length and the overall focus. Flavors are tightly woven—purple fruits, butterscotch, mocha, moist earth and baking spices—but nothing is overwrought. This will need considerable breathing time to unwrap, and years in the bottle to soften some of the hard edges.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,91,29.0
126314,"Here's another exceptional Oregon Riesling to add to the growing ranks of top producers.

The length and concentration are simply spectacular.",US,Viognier,96,70.0
59855,"There is a savory touch of salt and herb amidst the fruity mirabelle plum notes on the nose.

88063,"Firmly tannic, this is the rare example of a lower-priced wine that deserves some time in the cellar. There's a sense of coolness and restraint to this wine at first.

48124,"One of the major growers in Leyda also makes classic cool-coast SB. This is briny and tight on the nose, with a hint of asparagus. A lean, juicy palate is tight as nails, while this tastes of briny, salty lime and melon. A lean, chalky finish shows strong grip.",Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,89,18.0

34096,"Whiffs of Assam tea and honey permeate throughout this bright, bristling spätlese accenting succulent yellow peach and tangerine flavors.

98653,"This is the type of wine they love in Emilia-Romagna. A rich berry nose begins things. In the mouth, there's wonderful texture, balance, and a persistent berry finish.

45952,"Made in the rich, ripe, over-the-top style that winemaker Mark McNeilly uses for his own Mark Ryan Viogniers, this is a superconcentrated wine with more than a passing resemblance to limoncello. Along with that comes notes of Key lime, candied pineapple and a bit of alcoholic heat. Some will find it excellent, others a little too extravagant.",US,Viognier,90,35.0
38778,"One of the single-vineyard wines produced by Dauny, this is a wine with great freshness while also having a rich character from the southerly exposure of the vines. Still young, it is all tangy acidity and needs to age. Drink from 2016.",France,Sauvignon Blanc,89,25.0

68776,"Minty and sheer on the nose, and that's a prime indicator of what's to come, namely high-toned, lean fruit flavors and an abundance of scouring, protruding acidity.

49662,"In the North Coast, Sauvignon Blanc achieves grassy, herbal, lemony flavors, is tart and a little sour, and has high acidity. So it is with this wine. The trick is to soften it.

90581,"Five vineyards contribute their best barrels to this outstanding blend, which carries the humble Oregon AVA on its label.

48555,"A dramatically rich Syrah made along Northern Rhône lines. Dry, full-bodied and tannic, its flavors now are primary and fresh, suggesting summer blackberries, a few of them shriveled into raisins, and the whole sprinkled with cassis and black pepper. Needs time. Better after 2013.",US,Syrah,93,45.0
92105,"This nose from the actor-turned-vintner's family vineyard shows tight aromas of chalk, rain on cement and lime pith and blossoms. The laser-focused palate holds to the lime-pith lead, also showing ruby-red grapefruit juice, but exercising a lot of clean restraint.",US,Viognier,91,36.0
44392,"This wine starts out strongly reduced, making it a challenge to get at the pink grapefruit, lychee and spice aromas. The flavors drink just off dry, with high wire acidity. There are good things going on but the reduction is a challenge to overcome.",US,Gewürztraminer,87,25.0
30239,"A soft, gentle wine, this is clean and purely fruity. With ripe pear and apple flavors, it gets a tang of lemon acidity. It's already drinkable, but could age for several more months.",Portugal,Arinto,86,14.0
88239,"The veteran winemaker's blend of Grenache Blanc, Marsanne and Roussanne shows yellow melon, caramelized pear and a touch of marzipan on the nose.

72555,"The reserve seems to have spent more time in barrel, bearing a chocolatey finish, but otherwise it is quite similar to the Marryhill's regular Sangiovese.

106656,"If blackberry preserves and black licorice were made into a wine, this would be it. While Yarden's T2 dry blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Cao is a very good wine, this sweet Port-style wine misses the mark. With a nose of blackberry preserves, cassis and rose petal—and flavors of blackberry, cassis, licorice and clove—it should be gorgeous in the mouth. However, the overall sweetness is cloying without necessary balance.",Israel,Red Blend,84,44.0
81383,"Curiously lean, given the fine vintage. It's filled with green, stalky aromas and flavors. The palate wants to find some ripe berries and discovers only tart acids and austerity.

106415,"Dark in color, then jammy on the nose, this oaky specimen has heavily extracted berry aromas. In the mouth, there's a level of freshness offset by heavy fruit content. Flavors of berry and plum are chocolaty up front and finish with spice, pepper and additional chocolate richness. Drink through 2018.",Argentina,Malbec,91,79.0
62719,"The oak (40% new French) seems a bit overweighted for the fruit that is in the glass, delivering notes of char in front of popcorn butter (full malolactic fermentation) and peach. Some interesting things are going on but they don't quite all hang together.",US,Chardonnay,87,26.0
6782,"A clean, crisp nose of spice, red fruit and minerals on the nose leads into bright, fresh flavors of oak and spiced fruit on the palate.

91471,"This field blend of 50% Grenache 32% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre, the lots co-fermented, impresses with dense blue fruit and meat and lavender accents. Big and brawny on the palate, it reveals more leather and black pepper intrigue as it opens in the glass.",US,Rhône-style Red Blend,92,60.0
2612,"This is a blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Willow and Dineen, respectively. Though it falls on the lighter side for Washington Syrah, it's proportionate and pleasing, with strawberry fruit, mocha and toast.

19820,"Foursquare, almost chunky, the tannins dominate black fruits, dark chocolate and spice flavors. There is considerable concentration here, along with initial high acidity.

39500,"Simple, with jammy pineapple, mango and vanilla cream flavors that finish sugary sweet.",US,Chardonnay,82,12.0
13567,"This is described as a country-style wine because of its rugged tannins and angular, rough mouthfeel. The deeply plummy flavors are ripe, but very dry. The biggest problem may be the acids, which are very low. You long for more crispness and life, something to offset the fruitiness.",US,Merlot,84,23.0

54747,"From what may well be the most beautiful vineyard in Italy comes this gorgeous expression of elegance and power.

80058,"There's a delicacy to this Pinot that makes it a welcome alternative to the big, clumsy style. The color is translucent, and the alcohol is relatively low, giving it a nice, bouncy mouthfeel.

51348,"A gorgeous mélange of botrytized Riesling and Chardonnay, every sip of this honey-kissed wine is an explosion of blossom and fruit. It's intensely concentrated, rippling with tropical tones of mango, melon and pineapple, yet featherlight on the palate. The finish is languorous, alternating sweet layers of honey and marmalade marked by hints of salt and crushed mineral. Delicious now but should only improve with age, well beyond 2025.",US,Riesling-Chardonnay,94,40.0

The palate demonstrates lovely energy and elegance, with peach and tropical fruit flavors accented by mineral and almond.",Italy,Pecorino,90,16.0

94331,"Difficult to categorize, although the winery calls it a ”rosato,” this wine contains 86% white Moscato, but gets its red color from the addition of 14% Cabernet Franc. Light and bright, with a touch of sweetness (2.89% residual sugar), its flavors veer toward ripe strawberry purée and dark plum. It retains enough acidity to not taste cloying, though, and it is light in alcohol.",US,Moscato,85,20.0
120306,"Some unripe, vegetal notes lower the score on this otherwise pleasant Syrah. They interfere with your full enjoyment of black cherries and cassis, and also make aging impossible. Drink up.",US,Syrah,84,28.0
84485,"Fonréaud's vineyard is on the highest point of the Médoc (all of 120 feet). This vintage shows a smooth, ripe wine full of juicy black fruits. It's not dense, and the fruitiness will let it age relatively quickly. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90,21.0

46875,"Based around a blend of grand cru wines and with seven years aging, this wine combines a rich texture with tight acidity and hints of toast from the wood fermentation.

37719,"Cherry and crisp red currant aromas are racy and tutti-frutti in character. The palate delivers kick and acidity in addition to dry, pithy flavors of citrus fruits and nectarine. Dryness persists onto the finish, which is friendly but modest.",Spain,Rosé,85,8.0

69307,"Thirty bucks may seem like a lot for an entry-level Riesling, but this is an exemplary example. Aromas of wet stones, moss and spring flowers are mouthwatering, and then are followed by a complex array of nonfruity flavors, like stones and greens carried along by a mouthfeel that's light as a feather. Tart pineapple emerges on the long finish. Drink anytime over the next 10 years.",Germany,Riesling,90,29.0
129496,"Attractive oak and baking-spice aromas enhance the solid, straightforward and ripe fruit flavors in this full-bodied and nicely tannic dry wine.",US,Red Blend,88,22.0
118772,"Brisk in acidity and minerally, with a tantalizing scour of steel, this Riesling is so clean and stimulating. With green apple, citrus and floral flavors, it straddles the boundary between dry and just off-dry. What a wonderful cocktail wine with puff pastry appetizers.",US,Riesling,88,18.0
39284,"Murky, stewy, soupy aromas deliver little to no freshness or fruit, while the palate is tannic and tastes bitter, mildly weedy and minty. Seems roasted and devoid of quality. Unclean and unimpressive.",Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon,80,15.0

20184,"Here's a structured and spicy Barbera with an enticing fragrance of black fruits, white pepper and exotic spices. The palate is round and smooth, delivering a tight core of black cherry along with black pepper, cinnamon, mint and thyme. It's delicious now, but thanks to refreshing acidity will also stand the test of time. Drink now through 2020.",Italy,Barbera,90,32.0
13526,"This is a rugged, firmly tannic rendering of Châteauneuf-du-Pape that requires time in the cellar to reach its full potential. That said, it may also pose a risk, because there are hints of Band-Aid on the nose and a slightly metallic edge to the finish that may worsen over time. The other flavors are potent and concentrated: plum, chocolate and licorice all leave lasting impressions on the palate. Try after 2016.",France,Rhône-style Red Blend,92,77.0
25453,"This 100% Merlot from the Entre-deux-Mers, made in the style of a grand cru, is rich, spicy and full of superripe blackberry flavors. From low yielding, high density vines, it is big and concentrated, with hints of wood under the weight of the fruit.",France,Merlot,91,
118243,"Crushed violet, woodland berry, eucalyptus and cake spice aromas meld in the glass. The structured palate doles out dried black cherry, licorice, espresso and white pepper alongside tight, fine-grained tannins. It closes on a note of chopped sage. Drink 2017–2022.",Italy,Nebbiolo,91,40.0

10604,"Pale in the extreme, this wood-aged wine is a sister to the estate's top cuvée, Garrus. This wine is maybe less intense and more approachable when young, although still with the same beautiful fruit. Red berries shine through the edge of toastiness and spice, balanced by good acidity.",France,Rosé,91,65.0
21713,"In comparison with the 2008 Cabernet, this is the bigger wine, less sleek, more chewy. As it opens in the glass, the aromas display incense scents, and there is assertive, blocky, chewy fruit––especially black cherry. The tannins are also bigger, blockier, more substantial than the Cabernet. With hours of breathing time, exotic spices (saffron and more) emerge.",US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,96,135.0
39573,"Once past a surprisingly minty open, this stiff and earthy Malbec tightens up into a Bordeaux-like cocoon. It's an austere wine, that slowly reveals dark cassis fruit, dried herbs, and a finishing whiff of coconut. Give it plenty of breathing time, or decant.",US,Malbec,88,29.0

Rich and opulent in every way, notes of baked red apple, lemon verbena, honey-drizzled peach and sweet orange oil flood the nose and mouth, while additional flavors of hazelnut cream, fig bread and soft sweet spice carry into the long finish. Round, but with enough acidic lift to keep it from being flabby. Drink now–2015.",South Africa,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,92,30.0

30292,"With brisk acidity and a tight, minerally feeling, this Pinot Noir is very dry, showing robust cherry flavors. It seems like an ager, but some raisiny overripeness might compromise it.",US,Pinot Noir,87,54.0
54098,"Meaty and very oaky, with resin, mocha and milky aromas that amount to a wood cutter's dream. Not surprisingly, the mouthfeel is more shocking and acidic than the oaky bouquet suggests; flavors are racy and tart, and then a bitter lactic quality comes on strong. Too much going on, with nothing pulling in the same direction.",Spain,Tempranillo,83,15.0
95342,"Aromas suggesting ripe berry, exotic spice, Alpine herb and a whiff of blue flower come together in the glass.

58132,"This Livermore-based producer continues to impress with a range of Spanish, Italian and Portuguese whites. This Verdelho no exception, a grape that in Europe makes its way into Madeira.

The alcohol is 15.2%.",US,Petite Sirah,93,45.0
58368,"This is a Chardonnay for red wine lovers. It's full bodied and oaky, and it grows better as it warms in the glass.

The oak develops too, with buttered toast and butterscotch notes bringing additional richness.",US,Chardonnay,95,75.0
35332,"Very firm, this is a structured, relatively austere wine, with lots of minerality and tightness. The green fruits are  pierced with acidity, but also very fresh. A wine that needs time, give this at least 5–6 years. Screwcap.",France,Chardonnay,93,75.0
105608,"Made with 85% Carignano, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this open with aromas of black-skinned berry, cedar and oak.

The acidity is racy and clean.",US,Chardonnay,88,30.0
72408,"Despite the reserve and late harvest designations, this fits in more comfortably with a standard, off-dry Washington Riesling. The 4% residual sugar is muted by good acidity and firm pear and peach fruit. There's some phenolic bite in the finish, and a hint of plastic.",US,Riesling,85,12.0
125830,"A spectacular Chardonnay—this is dazzingly beautiful and mesmerizing in its appeal. The complexity of flavor stuns, offering tiers of pineapples, oranges, green apples and golden mangoes.

13340,"The vineyard is one of the youngest at the winery, and the flavors reflect that, with bright, fruity, forward raspberry notes.

100292,"The very gentle but seductive notion of sun-ripened red-cheeked mirabelle plums radiates like sunshine from the glass. With a further sniff there also is peppery greenery: yarrow and hay. The palate also unites this friendly fruit with the savory spice of these herbs and comes in a light-footed, compact and fresh package that just dances on the tongue.

111032,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't.

125826,"While this smells floral and candied, the palate rages, courtesy of strapping acidity that creates tart plum and blueberry flavors.",Argentina,Malbec,80,5.0
76738,"Expensive, yes, but impressive for its deep, long flavors of cherries, blackberries and oak. It's coarsely tannic and bold in profile, but give it an hour or two in the decanter and enjoy with steak.",US,Merlot,90,64.0
72443,"The high-toned aromas of raspberry, barrel spice and herb bring a touch of heat along with them. The palate offers tart tangy acidity, with the tannins seeming a bit bunched up.",US,Sangiovese,87,36.0
80525,"Kim Crawford is the leading Sauvignon Blanc in the U.S., but it turns out Winemaker Anthony Walkenhorst knows a thing or two about making Pinot Gris as well. This dry, medium-bodied wine is partially fermented in acacia barrels. Baking spices, like cinnamon and clove, add welcome nuance to the fresh pear and pineapple flavors.",New Zealand,Pinot Gris,88,28.0
115621,"The third vintage of this wine is 100% varietal, with the fruit coming from Stone Tree, Cold Creek and Beverly vineyards. Aromas of coffee, vanilla, clove, dark plum and spice lead to concentrated, layered but still elegant fruit flavors.",US,Merlot,91,85.0
57495,"This is a lightly smoky wine from vineyards in the hills behind the Côte de Beaune. It is spicy with a touch of wood as well as red-cherry fruitiness. The wine needs to age a few months, so drink from late 2018.",France,Pinot Noir,87,
45553,"Lifted peach and wilting petals of Damask rose unite in the perfumed, supremely aromatic nose of this wine. The palate continues with rosewater notes of Turkish Delight and candied peach. Honeyed and rich, the sweet palate is concentrated but guided by lemony freshness. Overwhelming with perfume and concentration, this decadent wine needs either a perfumed, peachy dessert or a salty blue cheese to match those crashing waves of full-blown flavor.",France,Gewürztraminer,90,55.0
46242,"Dry, robust and gritty in tannins, this country-style wine also has a hefty dose of acidity. Its blackberry flavors are tinged with earthy notes of coffee and tobacco. Needs something rich and oily, like lasagna.",US,Barbera,86,26.0
80612,"This is nearly equal parts Shiraz, Mataro and Grenache, full bodied and creamy in texture. Black cherries and peppery spice show up on the nose, while the palate adds brighter red raspberries, bass notes of ripe plums, sweet hints of brown sugar and savory, meaty complexity. Drink now–2020.",Australia,Red Blend,92,20.0

41691,"Pure is yet another addition to Trapiche's overflowing stable of Malbecs. This is big, grabby and shows chocolate, floral, herbal and perfumed berry aromas. A choppy but flush mouthfeel stages herbal-leaning, red-fruit flavors that carry a touch of green that's seconded on a minty, herbal, plump feeling finish.",Argentina,Malbec,89,18.0
44503,"Gushing with bright strawberry and raspberry aromas and flavors, this wine tastes fresh and delicious, lively and fun. It's dry, well balanced, moderately tannic, and has an appetizing, grippy texture.",US,Red Blend,88,20.0
61712,"With just the right amount of bottle aging, this almost bone-dry Champagne is tight, steely while also hinting at the beginnings of toastiness. It is also full of crisp apple, lemon and pink grapefruit fruitiness, well integrated into the taut texture. Drink now for freshness, age for even more toastiness.",France,Champagne Blend,93,80.0
59621,"Exuberant on the nose with aromas of ripe red cherries, peppery spices, herbs and just a touch of funky earth tones, there's a pleasurable rusticity to this Cabernet Franc. It's boldly structured with rich body and dense, drying tannins that hug the finish. It's lovely now, but should continue to evolve well over the next 3-5 years.",US,Cabernet Franc,88,17.0
100743,"87-89 Barrel sample. With its lovely fresh fruit, gentle tannins, spice and acidity, this is an easy, open, gentle wine. The fruit is ripe and floral.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88,
120232,"This bottling offers plum and plump blackberry on the nose along with milk chocolate, leather and cedar. It's quite tight and tannic on the palate at first, but all the expected and delicious components are in place: tart blueberry, tobacco, coffee and hints of licorice and chocolate that will emerge emerge more with time.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,65.0
124879,"This blend of all six Bordeaux varieties is lighter in color and offers wound-up aromas of savory herb, char, exotic spice, green pepper and cherry. The flavors are light and silky in feel, intertwining with charry barrel notes on the lingering finish.",US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88,32.0
129029,"Orange-blossom aromas and lush, broad flavors like banana and pineapple make a good combo in this medium-bodied, soft and richly textured wine. It fermented in oval wood casks and aged eight months on the lees.",US,Pinot Gris,88,20.0
65637,"Plum, white peach, pineapple and mango show on the nose of this wine that is quite tropical in aromas. The palate offers yellow pear, buttered toast and salty acidity that come together in a delicious package that is affordable and widely available.",US,Chardonnay,90,18.0
60348,"J has taken the unusual step of blending Pinot Noir with Pinot Meunier, which is not so strange, but also with Pinotage, which is practically unheard of. The addition of the latter certainly makes the wine darker, heavier and more tannic than it ordinarily would be. It also brings an earthiness to Pinot's vibrant cherries. It's an oddball, but a charming one to drink with rich winter stews.",US,Pinot Noir,89,50.0
108777,"Whiffs of hazelnut and raspberry introduce this dry Blanc de Noir, a white wine made from Pinot Noir grapes. Red berry flavors on the palate run a touch ruddy, but vibrant acidity brightens the finish. Drink now.",Germany,Pinot Noir,85,16.0

62557,"Fortress's Sauvignon Blanc, based on the Musque clone, is seriously good at a fair price, and now they've blended it with some Sémillon to produce this slightly sweet dessert wine. With residual sugar of 5.3%, it shows crisp acidity and wonderfully pure flavors of ripe pears, peaches and vanilla.",US,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,88,20.0
109232,"This is dry and brisk in acidity, with firm tannins and great structural integrity. At the same time, it's vast in blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, while the oak overlay is strong but perfectly matched with the wine's volume. Very fine, complex and elegant, this is a Cabernet to cellar for eight years; it could be one for the long haul.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,95,80.0
40218,"Pinot Gris can often show a little bit of a tawny blush, as it's a fairly dark-skinned white grape, but this is downright coppery, like a French Rosé. It's closer to an Oregon style than to other Washington Pinot Gris, with fleshy pear-flavored fruit and light hints of cinnamon and baking spices. Gets off to a good start, then falls away quite rapidly into a quick, generic finish.",US,Pinot Gris,86,16.0
113053,"Showing surprising structure for the vintage, this medium-bodied white offers aromas of honey, nut, pressed flower and peach. The flavors follow through to the vibrant palate, along with mineral and tangy acidity.",Italy,Favorita,90,40.0
46115,"This is a concentrated yet delightfully light-footed elixir of fruit and flowers. Intensely perfumed, it wafts of sweet cantaloupe, honey and pollen. The palate balances lush white peach and hibiscus nectars against a scintillating backdrop of acidity. It's persistent and steely on the finish.",Germany,Riesling,93,30.0
125689,"Practically opaque, this Bordeaux-style red blend shows rich dark cherry, blackberry syrup, star anise and tobacco on the nose. The full palate is heavy with ripe dark fruit, leading to a warm baking-spice kick on the finish.",US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86,100.0
77209,This is a strange version of the Sauvignon Blanc. It is vegetal and herbal with a salty edge from the ocean breezes close by. The fruitiness of the grape is missing in this lightly toasty wine. Drink now.,Portugal,Sauvignon Blanc,82,19.0
41845,"A stunningly good Cabernet. Just dazzling in sheer delicious fruit, yet wonderfully structured. So smooth and velvety, flooding the mouth with layers of blackberries, black cherries, cassis, chocolate, mint, spice and toast. The tannins are thrilling, being firm and soft at the same time. The vineyard sourcing was Star, in Rutherford, and Stagecoach, on Atlas Peak, with a few drops from Beckstoffer To Kalon. Very great now, and should develop over the next 10 years.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,96,72.0
121838,"This seems heavy and sweet for a Pinot Gris, with flavors of white sugar, orange and vanilla.",US,Pinot Gris,84,22.0
121052,"Light pink in color with a slight yellowish orange hue, this delicate bottling shows light plum and strawberry on the nose along with a prominent chalky character. The sip's balanced acidity and steely, gunmetal minerality carry flavors of red cherry, berry and plum, and it remains zesty long after opening.",US,Pinot Noir,90,23.0
115358,"There is a stunningly unique resinous quality on the nose and palate of this wine by Dan Kessler, very much like the aromatic, crystalline sap that comes from the obscure dragon's blood tree. There's also root beer, cinnamon, dried orange rinds, raspberry tea and potpourri in the nose, and mulberry, black tea and spiced cherry on the palate.",US,Pinot Noir,92,40.0
56270,"The sweetness gauge on the back label indicates this as medium dry, and at 3.2% residual sugar, there is more than a hint of sweetness. It's all in fine balance, full flavored, fruity and round. A mix of peaches, apricots and Mandarin oranges makes this an interesting Riesling with some complexity.",US,Riesling,88,11.0
61619,"This reserva from a warm year smells like crushed rocks, clay, wood smoke and spiced berry fruits. The palate is rubbery and tannic but bold, while oaky, roasted flavors of spiced black fruits and toast finish lightly baked and chocolaty. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo,90,28.0
82536,"An o.k. everyday Cabernet. It's a little scoury in the mouth, with some green flavors alongside the sweet blackberries.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,83,18.0
29491,"Floral and honey aromas are touched with earthy hints of saffron and pollen on this bold, lushly textured Riesling. The palate is quite full bodied, with intense flavors of stone fruits, poached pears and spice, but finishes long and elegant.",US,Riesling,89,36.0
100451,"Leathery and peanutty on the nose; soon the aromas expand to baked plum and stewy berries. The palate is sturdy and tannic, but there's enough flesh and weight to the fruit that it's mostly balanced. Finishes with bacon and leather accents.",Spain,Tempranillo,84,25.0
98357,"Drinkable, but it has vegetable, blackberry and sugar flavors that finish cloyingly sweet and simple.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,82,50.0
60868,"Tan in color and bland as a whole, with vanilla and pear aromas that do little to allure or entice. Strained and pickled tasting, with a heavy, overdone overall style. Pushes the definition of “acceptable.”",Chile,Chardonnay,81,15.0
83643,"This leads off with aromas of mature black fruit, toasted oak, coffee bean and a whiff of balsamic herbs. The ripe palate delivers fleshy red cherry and black raspberry with layers of cocoa, espresso and sage alongside bracing tannins.",Italy,Nebbiolo,90,65.0
61624,"Principally a Bordeaux-style blend, with some Oregon Zinfandel included, this is toasty and dark, a muscular wine offering strawberry preserves, cassis, cola and a swirl of smoke. Quite young and fruit-powered, it's got the concentration to develop further 2018–2020.",US,Red Blend,90,24.0
87091,"A bit stemmy, also a little underripe, with some minty, vegetal notes marring otherwise fine raspberries and cherries. Drink now.",US,Pinot Noir,85,40.0

47411,"Simple, dry and acidic, this has raspberry and red currant flavors as well as an underripe note.",US,Pinot Noir,82,22.0
112527,"Aromas suggesting mature plum, scorched earth, clove, menthol and a hint of iris lead the nose. The ripe, one-dimensional palate offers mature black cherry, raspberry jam and cooking spice alongside fine-grained but not very persistent tannins. Drink through 2020.",Italy,Sangiovese,88,50.0
70983,"A beautiful Chardonnay at a great price compared to what's out there. Shows brilliantly ripe pineapple, pear and guava flavors, with crisp Central Coast acidity and a bracing minerality. Nice to drink by itself, with shellfish or even with a citrus fruit pastry for dessert.",US,Chardonnay,90,20.0
67054,There are flavors of sweet wood along with spice and red-berry fruits in this attractive wine. It has enough freshness and acidity to give it a good lift. The wine is smooth and attractively perfumed.,Portugal,Port,87,17.0
121245,"Achaval-Ferrer's wines are unique across the board. This one from La Consulta in the Uco Valley shows boysenberry aromas with an herbal cut and a note of leather. The palate is at once juicy and smooth—flavors of desert brush, herbs, blueberry, savory plum and mixed spices finish with energy and subtlety. Drink through 2023.",Argentina,Malbec,94,140.0
91126,"Complex and individualistic, this conveys a savory rather than fruity personality. Smoky, meaty aromas lead to spice-accented plum and berry flavors. It feels full-bodied but not hot, has a suave texture and lingering finish. The first vintage to be released from the new Roederer-owned winery.",US,Pinot Noir,91,50.0
27063,"Unctuously ripe melon and tangerine aromas turn flintier and earthier on the palate in this full-bodied Riesling. It's dry and densely textured, heaving with silken layers of lime and lemon, but vivaciously brisk. The finish is long and nuanced, amplified by subtle cardamom and sweet spice hints. It's beautiful now but should improve further through at least 2025.",Germany,Riesling,94,72.0
97839,"Although a flinty touch of reduction still hangs on the nose, freshness and verve await underneath. The palate is juicy, slight, dry and very refreshing. It offers a slender, lemony expression of Pinot Blanc with a clean-cut finish.",Austria,Pinot Blanc,89,18.0
24912,"American and Hungarian oak barrels were used, adding a rustic, powerful base to this pure Primitivo. Think Zinfandel crossed with Lemberger and you're in the ballpark of its style. Its raw, big-boned flavors of fruit and barrel are ready for a juicy steak.",US,Primitivo,87,30.0
52598,"This Romanian Cabernet Sauvignon smells like black raspberry, cherry vanilla and a touch of mint. There are flavors of red berries and red plum on the palate.",Romania,Cabernet Sauvignon,85,7.0
122422,"This stunning TBA is a powerhouse of superripe peach, mango and orange flavors. The palate feels smooth and rich, with honey and marmalade flavors, but it's ethereally light, with a dusty minerality and shrieking lemon acidity that reverberates on the finish. Gorgeous now, but should develop an earthy, honeyed intensity over the next decade.",Germany,Riesling,96,440.0
84869,Rich aromas like Anjou pears and rose petals combine with generous ripe pear and vanilla flavors. It feels full-bodied but is light in alcohol and has a soothing texture. Good acidity balances the ripeness and the finish lingers.,US,White Blend,88,14.0
34645,"The English Reynolds family arrived in the Alentejo in the 1850s to deal in cork. The vines are in the east of the region, close to Spain. This wine, named after Gloria, the mother of the current owner, is a massive, mature cathedral of a wine. It is packed with dark leather, sweet plums and a dry core that's likely to keep the wine in this finely mature state for many years. Drink now.",Portugal,Portuguese Red,94,90.0
102010,"Available at an attractively low price, this oak-aged Aglianico opens with dark, brooding tones of cassis, dark spice, resin, tar and black licorice. The mouthfeel is firm and tight, making this wine suitable for a fatty meat dish such as a juicy cheeseburger.",Italy,Aglianico,86,13.0
7363,"This shows stalky, corny notes on the nose along with mineral and white-fruit scents. There's a lemony quality to an otherwise neutral palate, while saline, lemon and mild but increasing bitterness control the flavor profile and finish.",Spain,Albariño,88,25.0
14550,"This wine is soft, a gentle meander through white fruit flavors and light acidity. It has an attractive fresh character at the end.",Portugal,Portuguese White,84,

30441,"Oaky and buttery all the way, this unabashedly old-fashioned Chardonnay will certainly appeal to those who love that style. It's a big chunky blocky wine, with simple, generic fruit awash in oak.",US,Chardonnay,87,35.0
111570,"Juicy black fruit, tobacco, tar and leather notes provide a muscular edge to this medium-bodied wine, which is shy on fruit flavor but bold with structure and complex, gravelly, dusty tannin.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,65.0
20403,"Huge in structure and monolithic in flavor, this young, rough-cut wine will need until at least 2020 to show its best stuff. This variety is known for aging well, so it's not much of a gamble. The color is black with a dark, smoky rim, the aromas are like charcoal and blackberry jam, and the flavors seem saturated with fine tannins.",US,Petite Sirah,89,22.0
85451,"A little sharp, with a sting throughout, but otherwise a fine, classic Cabernet brimming with flavor. Shows upfront blackberries, currants, chocolate-covered cherries, smoky vanilla and toast, wrapped into smooth, sturdy tannins. Could mellow and soften in the next several years.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,88,33.0
65284,"Minerally raw aromas brush up against harsh. This is razor sharp, with cutting acidity. Flavors of lemon-lime and tangerine peel lean towards sour due to high acidity. This turns more pickled and briny on the finish.",Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,86,
83597,"This medium-bodied wine hits all the requisite Sauvignon Blanc marks. Herbal? Check. Passion fruit? Check. Crisp, mouthwatering finish? Check. It's a reasonably good value, especially if you can find it discounted.",New Zealand,Sauvignon Blanc,87,15.0

50485,"Already possessing the deep, old gold color of a mature dessert wine, this lush Viognier tastes fresh as a daisy. Its crisp acids frame sweet flavors of apricots, oranges, vanilla custard, white chocolate and honey. It's not an ager, though, so drink now.",US,Viognier,89,32.0
92042,Slightly sweet and confected with raspberry fruit roll-up and berry preserve aromas. A glimmer of crushed carnation flavors switch things up in the lightweight but round and soft mouth.,South Africa,Shiraz,85,17.0
38639,"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It leans slightly into the green, with aromas of fresh herbs mixed with vanilla, chocolate and other barrel spices. The palate is elegant, with a soft feel to the chocolate, cherry and barrel flavors.",US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89,20.0
71513,"Pretty scents and flavors suggest raspberry jam and blueberry compote; then some rather scrapey acids and stiff tannins kick in. The excellent fruit is there to begin, but it quickly turns one dimensional and finishes tannic and stemmy.",US,Syrah,86,42.0
34530,"Perhaps an unrepresentative bottle (just one was submitted), but this 2008 reserve was muddy in the glass and flabby in the mouth. Oaky and buttery to an extreme degree, it had lost all freshness and fruit.",US,Chardonnay,83,25.0
43612,"Warm and round, this has a generous character, while missing some of the attractive crispness of the vintage. It is ready to drink now, soft and fruity.",France,Chardonnay,84,20.0
60418,"Fine and supple, if a little sharp, with tart cherry jam, raspberry pie filling, cassis, red currant, black pepper and smoky oak flavors that finish dry and spicy. Best now, this stylish Grenache will pair well with rosemary and garlic-infused pepper steak.",US,Grenache,88,25.0
97393,"A crushed carnation aroma accents the ripe fruit core of strawberry, raspberry and mango on this selection. The palate is juicy and fruit forward, with red berry flavors, medium acidity and a subtle earthy spice that unfolds on the finish.",France,Rosé,87,15.0
75206,"A curiosity that's definitely worth trying, as aged Marsanne from anywhere other than Hermitage is a rarity. This features some hints of honey and toast on the nose, followed by notes of citrus and almond. It's round and mouthfilling on the palate, but falls away a bit quickly on the finish.",Australia,Marsanne,87,25.0
914,"Smashed berry aromas are backed by earth and toasty oak notes. Fairly hard and tannic on the palate, this shows herbal plum flavors in front of a bold finish with dry tannins and a hint of wood spice.",Argentina,Malbec,87,20.0

20927,Luce della Vite opens with an inky dark appearance and added extraction that is hard to find otherwise in 2008 Brunello. Soft aromas of cherry and blackberry are followed by supple fragrances of leather and spice. There is fruit pulp in the mouth and the wine's extra richness really helps to balance out its acidity and those still-young tannins.,Italy,Sangiovese Grosso,92,93.0
17723,"With hard tannins, sharp acids and dry, somewhat austere mouthfeel, this wine, blended with a drop of Malbec, distinguishes itself for its complexity. Blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and espresso flavors combine for interest. Yet the wine doesn't seem to be an ager. It needs rich, fatty meats and cheeses to balance the astringency.",US,Petit Verdot,87,65.0
114907,"Longtime value producer Firesteed has another winner. This pretty Pinot shows excellent ripeness and full-bodied fruit flavor, thanks to the southern-Oregon components. Strawberries and tart raspberries come through cleanly, with a touch of cola in the aftertaste.",US,Pinot Noir,88,17.0

48675,"This is one of those wines that tastes dramatic and important. It's marked by rich, thick tannins, but they're ripe and smooth, and frame complex flavors of blackberries, black cherries, grilled teriaki beef and black pepper, enriched with smoky cedar. Texturally, it's medium-bodied and velvety, like a Merlot.",US,Syrah,92,30.0

83590,"The winery's larger-production blend of several vineyard sources, given 20 months in American oak, this wine opens in pungent earth, soy and mushroom, reminiscent of a beef bouillon or beef stew. Big tannins surround the fruit, accented in black licorice and black coffee before finishing lean.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,38.0
124952,"There's a slightly smoky, fume character to this wine's otherwise ripe aromas of stone fruit, melon and fig, giving an extra layer of complexity.

82457,"A bright magenta color and aromas of toast, tobacco, cola and wild blackberry draw you in. This wine is young, and so the acidity shows through right now. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and black cherry come with a touch of oaky vanilla. That vanilla carries over to the finish, which is oaky, bright and scouring. This Carignan-Garnacha blend will be at its best from 2018–2024.",Spain,Red Blend,92,59.0
121542,"Musky aromas of red apple skins and stone fruits are mild but mostly clean. This Shiraz-Cabernet blend feels solid and full for rosé. Peppery, leafy flavors of spiced berry, apple and olive finish chunky, dry and slightly bitter.",Chile,Rosé,85,10.0
15643,"This gigantic Cabernet is not showing well now. The tannins are too strong, the fruit too fresh, sweet and direct in blackberries and cherries, the oak too unintegrated with everything else. It's like a bowl of ingredients that need to be cooked into a recipe. But the structure of tannins and acids is just fine, and while the alcohol is on the high side, the heat it gives is balanced into the overall mouthfeel. Give it 6–8 years to begin to come around.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,80.0
74485,"Grown on the higher ground near Anderson Valley, this wine has a rather light color with a transparent, tawny rim. It's a likeable, lean wine with vivid black tea, cranberry and red cherry in both the aromas and the flavor. Tannins are firm but light.

23873,"This Recioto opens with a beautiful, vibrant ruby color with purple highlights and deep dimension only to segue into typical aromas of bramble, blueberries, blackberry and chopped herbs. It's got power, sweetness and structure with chewy, tart tannins. Recioto is an ancient wine made with the same blend of grapes that goes into Amarone. Pair this sweet red with dried cinnamon cakes, chocolate-based desserts or a selection of aged cheeses.",Italy,Red Blend,90,

60782,"Lots of charred oak and leathery fruit start it out, and then you get runaway berry flavors and screechy, almost grabby tannins. It finally settles and smooths out with airing, but requires too much compromise on the part of the drinker. Has its good points but not enough of them.",Spain,Red Blend,83,17.0
26982,"From one of the Russian River's premier Sauvignon Blanc producers, although recent vintages have slipped in quality. The '09 is a good wine, dry and crisp, with citrus, gooseberry and spice flavors. But it's missing the richness of earlier vintages.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,87,35.0

20267,"Aromas of citrus peel, rubber, spice, and iodine lead to a tight, drawing but full-feeling palate. This tastes herbal, spicy and oaky, with carob accenting black fruit and berry flavors. A minty, oaky, resiny finish closes this out.",Chile,Syrah,88,20.0
36897,"All estate-grown and aged in one third new French oak, this elegant wine gives you the best that this difficult vintage can offer in a low-alcohol Pinot Noir.

91448,Ripe berry and cassis aromas are broadened by open-grain oak. This Cabernet is big and tannic.

Drink this warm-vintage wine through 2022.,Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,65.0
20928,"The Antinori family's Brunello estate has seen ups and downs in terms of wine consistency over the past five years. But 2008 delivers an honest and nicely concentrated expression that seems to benefit beautifully from the slightly warmer temperatures in its lower altitude vineyards. Dark chocolate, cherry fruit and barbecue spice appear on the finish.",Italy,Sangiovese Grosso,92,75.0
95253,"This weakly constituted Cabernet opens with raisiny aromas. Those are backed by a chunky, low-acid palate with raisin and baked plum flavors. The finish tastes baked and feels rubbery.",Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,82,9.0
797,"Produced from 30-year-old vines, this 55% Cabernet Sauvignon wine is firm with tannins as well as black-currant fruit.

69203,"The vineyard is near Occidental, in the cooler southwestern part of the valley, and you can taste the fog and the sea and crisp nights in the acidity, like biting into a Gravenstein apple. Yet this perfect vintage has resulted in perfect fruit. It's hard to imagine richer blackberry, cherry and licorice flavors. Impeccable and impressive, but young. Best in the narrow window of 2011–2013.",US,Pinot Noir,94,60.0

46114,"A blend from Jim Clendenen's own Le Bon Climat Vineyard and the Bien Nacido Vineyard where his winery is located, this bottling shows candied red cherry, star anise, fennel and sagebrush on the earthy but fruity nose.

81980,"Molasses, spice, chocolate and pure raisins define this as classic P.X. It's syrupy but not too much so, with maple, cinnamon and brown sugar flavors.

29022,"For a 2008, this seems to be developing rather quickly, showing toasty notes that emerge on the nose, expand on the palate and jump out on the finish, largely overshadowing the admirable citrus and crushed-stone elements. Drink now.",Germany,Riesling,87,70.0
17920,"Always one of the best Muscats in California, Eberle's '09 continues the tradition. It offers tangerine, pineapple, vanilla cream and honeysuckle flavors in a frankly sweet wine finished with brisk, cleansing acidity.",US,Muscat Canelli,87,15.0

83006,"Basic, minerally aromas of apple and pear are good and suggest iodine. The mouthfeel is a bit foamy, but this is also fresh and vital for a 2007 Cava. Crisp flavors of lime, orange and green herbs end similarly, with linear balance.",Spain,Sparkling Blend,87,12.0
84184,"Sometimes Pinot Blanc resembles Chardonnay, but this crisp, minerally, citrusy wine strikes a different pose. It does have a rich, creamy mouthfeel, which gives it a full-bodied mouthfeel, but it has a dry, steely character that makes it far friendlier with food than a fat, buttery Chard.",US,Pinot Blanc,88,20.0
129607,Too oaky and forward in tropical fruit flavors. Takes the popular style and exaggerates it. It will nonetheless appeal to lots of people.,US,Chardonnay,84,18.0

67636,"This wine was aged for 32 months in 85% new French oak but you'd never know it based on the vibrant aromas of iron, earth, bacon fat, black olive, garigue, orange peel, dried flower and purple fruit.

26443,"Ripe and generous, this floral wine is dense with fruit as much as tannins. It is full of blackberry and plum flavors, ripe while also cut with acidity. The spice that comes from the wood aging shows well, adding a further element. Drink the wine from 2022.",France,Pinot Noir,94,355.0
109523,"This is a blend from Aÿ on the Montagne de Reims and from the Côte des Blancs. It is intensely perfumed, with weight from Pinot Noir and crispness from Chardonnay.

66075,"This is one-third Cab Franc, one-third Merlot and one-third split between Syrah and Malbec—a who's who (or what's hot) of Southern Oregon viticulture.

114162,"This is just the third Sauvignon Blanc from Stevens (none was made in 2008), sourced from Klipsun vineyard and stainless steel fermented. Richly textural, with a creamy minerality, this has a pleasing intensity, a sort of nervosity (as the French might put it), lined with a sweet grain character. The fruits are tart and racy, a mix of citrus rind and pulp, tangerine and pineapple, finished with natural acidity.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,91,19.0
6571,"This is a rare venture by Olivier Leflaive outside his home territory around Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault. The wine is classic Corton-Charlemagne, big and bold, a broad-shouldered wine that brings together toastiness, ripe pineapple and mango and balancing, lively acidity. It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade.",France,Chardonnay,94,150.0
84786,"Opening aromas include forest floor, red berries, cooking spices and Mediterranean herbs. The juicy palate shows bright red berries, mint and thyme accented with notes of white pepper.

107466,"Hailing from the state's oldest Syrah vineyard, this wine displays aromas of pure blue fruit, assorted herbs and whiffs of smoked meat. The palate is dense and seamless, with fine-grained tannins providing support. Its best days are far in front of it. Best from 2022–2030.",US,Syrah,94,60.0
66896,"Penetrating strikes of honey, peach and chamomile charge through this light-footed yet powerful Kabinett. It's blossomy and perfumed from start to finish, lifted by a dazzling spray of lemon-lime acidity and lacy filigreed sweetness.

83359,"It's hard to exaggerate the purity of this wine, which is 100% Cabernet. It startles for the intensity of mountain blackberries and raspberries, and then a firm minerality kicks in, along with the tannins, providing grounding structure. The finish lasts for a full minute.

83686,"There's ample varietal typicity here, with black and white pepper and meat notes on top of layers of green herbs, and licorice. Structurally, however, the wine has a few sharp elbows, with dry tannins and a disjointed oak note. All this is topped off by a pleasant, Fernet Branca-spiked finish. Drink now.",US,Syrah,85,19.0

38021,"The Kanonkop Pinotage does a beautiful job of maintaining the grape's unique indigenous character—on the nose you'll find trademark smoke, banana and plum, and on the palate, like flavors, with an added clove and leather touch. There's also an appealing cherry-mocha spin that gives the wine additional draw. Pair with smoky BBQ ribs, steak.",South Africa,Pinotage,87,33.0
120240,"Deep garnet to the eye, this wine has a nose of strawberry and tart cherry with a hint of resin.

116971,"Despite some tough tannins on the finish, this is an intriguingly complex wine that may prove even better than this rating suggests.

82545,"Take an acidic grape like Sauvignon Gris and combine it with a cool year like 2011 and what you get is a tart, tight, steely wine like this.

65516,"After this opens with charred, roasted aromas, things settle on smoky black-fruit scents and savory notes.

124118,"A blend of three new Syrah clones that were fermented separately, then blended into a satisfying, though still young and somewhat jagged wine that will benefit from more bottle age.

It's delicious now but should gain depth and definition through 2025.",Germany,Riesling,93,42.0
61920,"Super-tannic, one of those dry Napa red wines that makes you wonder why you opened it now.

21714,"Gilles Nicault, who oversees the Long Shadows portfolio, makes this pure Cabernet. If this had a Napa Valley label on it, it could sell for three times the price. The structure is full and fleshy, but with the vividly bright fruit that screams Washington State.

It has tight tannins, a solid structure and fresh acidity.",Italy,Red Blend,90,40.0
103677,"Farmed under the winery's Nellaserra greenhouse system, this is an atypical blend for northern Michigan: 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Nebbiolo, 20% Merlot and 15% Syrah.

The round, medium-to full-bodied palate follows suit, with streaks of crushed stone giving levity all the way through to the lingering toasted-spice finish.",US,Red Blend,90,55.0
71816,"Whiffs of smoke and herbs add complexity to this beautifully floral, fruity wine.

The long finish has a bristle of lemon-zest astringency.",US,Riesling,90,14.0

60154,"This ambitious, impressively structured wine will appeal to those who run from wines made in the fruit-bomb style.

A year or two in the cellar will allow the grippy tannins to integrate.",US,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,84,46.0

86563,"Henry estate, Scott Henry explains, “is more Alsace/Burgundy country, but we feel we are on the ragged edge of pulling these Bordeaux guys off.” A fair and candid assessment.

8818,"Showing the richness and structure of the 2010 vintage, this is an opulent wine, full of black fruits. It has a dark structure, smoky bacon flavors and powerful tannins.

23353,"For those looking for a leaner, earthier but still-stylish Cabernet, this is the ticket. It's very dry, with soft Alexander Valley tannins and flavors of blackberries, cherries and herbs.

64612,"Clearly a winner, a wine that shows its terroir in the mineral, slate, vanilla and cotton candy aromas. The flavor is hard to describe, sort of a mix of tapioca, rasberry puree and gunflint. Very acidic and crisp, with a long, firm and steely finish that cries out for rich, complex foods.",US,Roussanne,91,32.0
48195,"A wine that is ripe and relatively soft. It does offer some dense tannins, but these are surrounded by rich black plum and ripe berry fruits. The structure comes from wood aging and fruit as much as from tannins. The final flavors are delicious, smoky and toasty.",France,Pinot Noir,93,

127908,"Charred earth, leafy underbrush, prune marinated in spirits and grilled herbs come together in the glass.

35342,"There have been Estate Selection Chards from Cuvaison before, but never a block bottling. This wine fully merits its status and price. Tightly angular and acidic in youth, it's very minerally, with a gunmetal tang to the oak-infused Meyer lemon, green apple and green pear flavors.

34613,"This delivers the best of both worlds for this aromatic grape. Crispy cut-grass notes blossom into tropical pineapple guava and green papaya. A laser focus of lime on the palate subsequently opens toward green pears, freshly cut oregano and dill, and an apple skin-driven bitterness.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,91,24.0

47173,"Dense, smoky aromas of well-toasted oak are lactic on impact, with blackberry and cassis scents in support. This is woody, resiny and tannic on the palate, which makes it rough now but bodes well for down the line. Charred, toasty oak and herbal blackberry flavors finish minty, with a speck of creosote. Drink through 2020.",Chile,Syrah,90,33.0

51967,"This bottling, from seven cool climate vineyards, makes a great intro into savory Syrah, showing all that peppery might without shoving it down the throat. Cracked peppercorn is redolent on the nose and palate, with the latter also showing raw lamb and beef char.

5489,"Ecco Domani delivers consistent, easy-drinking wines that work well on informal occasions, but don't necessarily offer personality or territorial typicity.

Better than the excellent 2008, a white Bordeaux-style wine to drink now.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,92,36.0

Although dry, it's ripe to the extreme and structured with moderate tannins.",US,Barbera,89,45.0
64187,"73% Merlot, with Cabernet and Petite Verdot making up the difference, this is a finely crafted and delicious effort. Medium-bodied and creamy, the Merlot gives this wine a feminine feel, despite solid, soft tannins.

Could use time to soften further, but very approachable now.",South Africa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,90,55.0

83670,"A bulky wine with aromas of dried herbs, pepper and black fruits. It's meaty and thick in the mouth, with grapey, herbal flavors.

109796,"Mountain-grown fruit gives this wine an exceptional intensity and purity of flavor. Tastes like the essence of blackberries, sprinkled with black pepper, anise and cocoa.

118479,"From a Merlot-dominated, 24-acre vineyard this is a strongly mineral wine, with young, dark tannins and a powerful structure. A more juicy, fruity side brings out black currants and berries. Together the structure and the fruit promise good aging. Drink from 2017.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89,40.0

Together, they produce a fruity, structured wine that is ready to drink.",Portugal,Portuguese Red,88,12.0
121510,"This luminous, garnet-colored wine opens with aromas that recall underbrush, earth, toast, red berry and hint of menthol.

66995,"A gamy, slightly stemmy and rubbery style of Bonarda that reflects the variety, Mendoza's terroir and the vineyard. Which doesn't mean that it's great; far from it, the wine is good but stemmy, with green-ish notes and reedy accents infiltrating the red-fruit flavors that control the palate.

83550,"Aromas of toasted oak, mocha and a whiff of coconut oak lead the nose while the firm palate offers dark cherry, espresso, dried sage and a hint of anise. The tightly wound tannins still pack youthful sharpness and need a few more years to soften up. Drink after 2021.",Italy,Nebbiolo,90,90.0
23299,"Don't be misled by the low alcohol; there's more than a smidgen of residual sugar in this wine. It works to good effect, adding richness to the fruit and roundness to the mouthfeel.

86952,"This is a little slow out of the gate, starting off with some rather cabbage-like aromas. Over time, the odors evolve toward smoke and ash, and, finally, into a complex, cedary aroma. The flavors of this medium-bodied blend (80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Malbec, 8% Merlot, 2% Petit Verdot) feature blackberry and cassis, but also fold in hints of smoked meat and vanilla before finishing crisp and long.

89615,"Heavy aromas of baked berry fruits and raisin suggest a bit of overripeness. On the palate, that take is confirmed by chunky weight offset by natural acidity.

83075,"The clear scent of root beet along with barrel char works, and so does the ripe palate that's full of red raspberry and chocolate. If none of that sounds like Cab Franc from the Loire Valley or elsewhere, it's not. In it's own right, this is a ripe, full-bodied wine that's oaky, tannic and big—but also quite clean. And the texture is pure new wave.",US,Cabernet Franc,88,28.0
112351,"This wine comes from the original Merlot blocks at this vineyard, planted in 1982. It's aromatic, with notes of plum, raspberry, clove and generous spices.

6165,"With its ripe, yellow fruit flavors, this is a gentle, soft, open wine, which offers immediately pleasure. There is more: the spice from the wood and the pear skin and nutmeg element adding complexity. That suggests aging for 2–3 years, possibly more. But also enjoy now.",France,Bordeaux-style White Blend,89,21.0
116188,"Syrah makes up 70% of this blend—the rest is Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a fine, focused effort that's smooth and immediately drinkable, with flavors of dried herb, dark chocolate and pretty blueberry pastry. The soft, smooth tannins encourage near term consumption.",US,Red Blend,90,28.0

The subtle, slightly grainy and grassy nuances of old-vine grapes are here, with red-fruit flavors that are soft and delicate, yet substantial.

106834,"Deep and hearty mulberry aromas meet with condensed rose petals, cinnamon, clove and hot gingerbread on the earthy, spicy nose of this clonal bottling by longtime winemaker Denise Shurtleff. The sip is thick and full of chaparral herbs at first, then opens toward rounded red cherry, cranberry and cinnamon before diving into fennel and peppercorn. It's amazing for one clone to be so complex.",US,Pinot Noir,94,80.0
45812,"A real success story for this hot vintage. Feels gracious and generous in the mouth, offering complex, fat flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, mocha and cedar that turn spicy on the finish. The tannins are elaborately ripe and fine. The well-known vineyard is on the Rutherford bench, and production was 2,300 cases. Drinkable now, and should age well for at least a decade.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,95,70.0
19772,"This well-made, well-priced wine over-delivers in terms of quality. Smoky cherry and plum accentuate the toasted oak, as a sturdy foundation of tannin gives it power and strength. The savory finish mixes forest and tea.",US,Pinot Noir,90,27.0
46757,"Pretty scents of grapefruit, green apple and wild flowers rise up from the glass, followed by tasty citrus in the form of orange, lemon and grapefruit. Some oak adds texture and character to the mix, while chalkiness provides grip to the finish.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,89,18.0

101775,"Fresh, herb and miso-tinged yeast for now is the chief flavor on this zesty, fresh and punchy yet slender little number.

58127,"Like many Marlborough Sauvignon Blancs, this one starts off leafy and pungent, then develops greater depth of white nectarine and grapefruit on the palate. It's plump, medium-bodied and slightly creamy in texture, making it an attractively versatile option.",New Zealand,Sauvignon Blanc,88,16.0
85316,"The lyra system of training vines is designed to give the fruit maximum exposure. With that and the vines' placement on the steep Heiligenstein hill, it's no surprise that this wine is ripe and rich. Perfumed, intense and generous, this will age for many years.",Austria,Riesling,95,71.0

55209,"This is a subtle, svelte and elegant wine, floral in rose petals and violet, the crisp, bright red fruit leaning more toward cranberry and pomegranate than juicy strawberry.

84462,"On the nose, this Carmenère is integrated and earthy, with cedar, black cherry, baked plum and spice aromas.

60037,"Sestina is the bigger sister to the winery's Gravura; again Cabernet Sauvignon takes front and center, with Merlot (18%) and Cabernet Franc (9%) filling in the rest. 70% of the French oak used was new, and the wine has more toast, smoke and barrel depth than its companion, though less of the luscious red fruit is showing. Espresso, cacao and other dark, roasted flavors wrap around black cherry cola and milk chocolate; the finish thoroughly delicious.",US,Red Blend,93,50.0

94842,"This fine offering from Victoria's Mornington Peninsula nails Pinot Noir's elusive texture, gliding across the palate in a silky veil. Cherry-berry fruit is framed by hints of brown sugar, coffee and vanilla, but the oak should integrate with a few more months' aging.",Australia,Pinot Noir,89,40.0
16235,"Aromatic of fresh apples and pears with just a hint of savory spice, this wine is full bodied yet refreshingly brisk. Dry in style with subtle apple flavors, it finishes with a pleasant tartness.",US,Pinot Blanc,87,14.0

It is very rich, full of fruit and acidity that cuts through the texture and structure. Drink from 2019.",France,Chardonnay,93,
87563,This is a bold rich wine—perhaps too rich. It has dense black fruits that go with the dark chocolate and licorice flavors. It still has young tannins and acidity and these need to soften. Drink this rich wine from late 2017.,France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85,18.0

35007,"Emmy is 70% Mourvèdre and 30% Syrah blend. The fruit expression is pure and powerful, an intense burst of raspberry and cranberry, anchored in mineral and chalk. Only neutral oak was used, so the fruit is framed beautifully by the acids and tannins, and it is so pure and resonant that it is hard to believe that this wine won't age beautifully for a decade or more.",US,Rhône-style Red Blend,92,36.0
115939,"This barrel-fermented Viura smells so woody and grainy that it suggests turpentine and/or lacquer. The palate is light in body, but with resiny stickiness. Flavors of white table grapes, orange and raw oak finish severely woody.",Spain,Viura,84,18.0

85706,"Joseph Jewell's 2009 Elk Prairie is even better than its 2008, which is saying something.

Bright, with a lingering finish, this Pinot Noir only gets better while in the glass.",US,Pinot Noir,93,39.0

31586,"This has a classic Nebbiolo nose of new leather, rose petal, red berry, tilled earth and a whiff of aniseed. On the palate, toast, white pepper and a hint of oak-driven spice back up a core of sour cherry. It's still tightly wound and needs a few more years to come together. Drink 2018–2025.",Italy,Nebbiolo,90,22.0
1519,"The nose is an attractive mix of cassis and mineral notes. The palate is more racy and wiry than dense and soft, with juicy, flashy flavors of berry, cherry and currant. Those notes all carry through to the long finish; drink from 2013–2018.",Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,92,38.0

57833,"John Chiarito is making Italian varieties like Nero d'Avola and Negro Amaro––as well as estate-grown Petite Sirah and Zinfandel––on the outskirts of Ukiah, from his basement winery.

Big and hearty, this wine has soul.",US,Zinfandel,92,21.0

98926,"The Legacy estate reserve sources the original mid-1970s vines. It's a delicate, high-wire act, balanced on a bed of rose petals. From the floral aromatics into flavors of red currant and black cherry, it takes you on a well-modulated joyride. Veins of anise, cola and clay add complexity, as the details expand into a lingering finish. Drink 2015–2030.",US,Pinot Noir,94,75.0

88924,"Ebullient with ripe cherry fruit, this intensely aromatic rosé is geared towards the white Zin drinker who's looking for a step up. While soft and a tad confectionery with a sweet, candied cherry palate, there's a crisp acidity throughout that keeps it from becoming too cloying.",US,Rosé,83,10.0
117320,"Lots of alcohol in this Zin, but it wears it well. It's a fat, unctuous wine, sweet in raspberries and cherries, with just a touch of savory raisins that give it a porty finish. Defines the Dry Creek style.",US,Zinfandel,89,28.0

17832,"This cuvée stands in firm contrast to the winery's more feminine-styled Dame de Piegros, showing the meaty, gamy side of Syrah, powerful spice and blackberry fruit and lashings of vanilla. Ends with firm acids and gripping tannins. This needs 3–4 years of cellaring.",France,Rhône-style Red Blend,86,

29272,"This big, spicy wine is very smooth and rich now, but also has the potential to age. Dusty tannins, perfumed fruits and a rich dense character offer the potential to drink in a year. This is a great expression of Cahors.",France,Malbec,90,24.0
119861,"Chocolate, cherries and baking spices make up the flavors of this layered and tasty wine. The color is dark, the texture is nicely astringent due to assertive tannins, and it conveys a sense of something held in reserve.",US,Tempranillo,89,29.0
35586,"The blend includes 2% Muscat, an experiment that may not be repeated, though it worked quite well, boosting the aromatics and adding pretty floral notes at the top.

Lovely balance and fullness throughout.",US,Chardonnay,91,25.0
86863,"Earthy aromas and meaty flavors make this medium-bodied wine a bit of a wild card. Consumers expecting an average red blend may find this too funky, but it does feel rich and have a lingering finish.",US,Red Blend,84,11.0

117032,"Wow, this is a glorious bottle of Pinot Noir. It was designed to celebrate the winery's 10th vintage (hence the name, Dix) and is a barrel selection of Maresh Vineyard grapes.

48434,"Tempranillo could be an interesting variety in South Australia going forward. This rosé features hints of sous bois and cherries on the nose, then adds melon and spice notes on the palate. It's plump in the mouth, then finishes on a dry, silky note.",Australia,Rosé,88,19.0
129392,"Bitter black cherries are the hallmark of this rather hard-edged wine. It shows dark tannins and fruit that misses full richness. Maybe it is restrained power, maybe it will age, but the balance is not there now.",France,Pinot Noir,85,36.0
38933,"Briny and dark copper-orange in color, this is a weighty wine, though the alcohol level is low. The tannins and leathery texture of the Syrah shine through, checked by tangy citrus and a hit of white pepper.",US,Rosé,88,20.0
55744,"This is a syrupy, ripe take on Grenache, which renders it varietally unrecognizable. There's a deep core of cassis and black cherry fruit, but any remaining details have been blown out by the alcohol.",US,Grenache,86,34.0
128272,"This wine was made with 76% whole-cluster fruit, and it shows with iron rich notes on the nose as well as strong thyme, dark hibiscus, crushed cinnamon stick and other powerful red spices.

6878,"One-quarter of this wine was fermented in neutral oak, the rest in stainless steel.

It offers the faintest suggestion of caramel as it winds down.",US,Pinot Blanc,89,22.0

94205,"The top of the range from Château Ponzac, this is, as its alcohol suggests, pretty powerful. Almost black in color, it's a solid, chunky wine that still has its youthful tannins.

68383,"So what does ten bucks buy in Pinot Noir? A light-bodied wine with tart, green strawberry, cola and cranberry flavors, plenty of crisp acids and smooth tannins.",US,Pinot Noir,84,10.0
34590,"Although it's 100% varietal and comes from one of the state's oldest Cabernet vineyards, this wine is somewhat blue-fruited for the variety, with notes of plum and mountain blueberry along with herb, graphite, espresso and spice. The palate shows more of the same, bringing a sense of restraint and polish along with lightly grainy tannins that need some time to stretch their legs. It doesn't scream Cabernet but it still brings plenty of appeal. Best after 2022.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,75.0
64026,"A skillful blending of 50% Barbera and 50% Nebbiolo, the Cogno has lovely wild strawberry aromas, cranberry and a touch of licorice. Light bodied but with fairly intense flavors, it was pleasant and interesting, its only fault lay in the slightly high acidity.",Italy,Red Blend,89,27.0
32572,"Savory, gritty raspberry and currant aromas are earthy, with a suggestion of Band-Aid. This Syrah-Garnacha blend feels rubbery and tannic, with a downward pull. Roasted red-berry and plum flavors finish with a note of grilled meat.",Spain,Syrah-Grenache,86,6.0
58480,"The small Sézanne region of Champagne is known for its Chardonnay (as exemplified by this wine) with its crisp mineral texture. The apple-skin and green-plum flavors are given an edge by the tight acidity and dryness. It could do with another few months in bottle, so drink this bottling from 2018.",France,Chardonnay,92,70.0
121162,"Citrus and tropical fruits dominate this rich wine, while the wood gives caramel. Full and mouthfilling, this is rounded, the acidity veering towards softness. The toast and white plum skins give structure to an open, generous wine.",France,Bordeaux-style White Blend,93,

46335,"About 30% was aged in new French oak, the rest in neutral wood. A bit closed, it offers tight, tart rhubarb and cherry fruit, with a fading wash of milk chocolate. It's a lighter style in a lighter vintage, but nicely balanced and drinking well.",US,Pinot Noir,88,35.0
44104,"Weird name, simple wine, but not a bad one. It's awfully hard to get distinction in Pinot Noir at this price. The wine is dry, and there are some berry flavors wrapped in silky tannins.",US,Pinot Noir,84,8.0
106909,"Reduced gritty foresty aromas revolve around herbal berry and plum fruit. This feels heavy, concentrated, tannic and slightly collapsed. Dark blackened herbal berry and chocolate flavors finish hard due to abrasive tannins and enamel-peeling acidity.",Chile,Cabernet Franc,87,19.0
14086,"With alcohol at just 12.7%, this is one of several under-13% Pinots tasted recently that seem to be setting a new trend in Oregon. The elegance is welcome, and gives the flighty grape some room for nuance and even terroir. Light berry, watermelon, hints of earth and a fine balance make this an excellent quaffer.",US,Pinot Noir,87,28.0

128929,"A wine that has firm extraction, giving licorice, smoky wood and bitter chocolate flavors. It does have weight, and there is a powerful sense of fruit.

45381,"It's a treat to taste this varietal that is so popular in Italy, but rarely bottled by California wineries. This is a big-impact wine that is not overly full bodied. It is dark colored, full of dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and black fig, and moderately tannic but also fresh and lively.",US,Montepulciano,88,28.0
103125,"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Syrah—this is a focused wine, with complex nuances of licorice, tar, mineral and lead pencil, but it is buttressed by the compact, concentrated red and black fruits.

77013,"A rich, smooth wine, classic Tempranillo, with the additional warmth of the Alentejo.

82734,"The style of this wine has evolved away from the massive ripeness and pure power in its early days to more finesse and ele­gance. It's still a rich wine, but silkier, with fresher fruit and more nuanced spice. Toasty oak seductively frames blueberry and plum fruit on the long finish. Drink now–2023.",New Zealand,Syrah,93,105.0
42388,"Though the vintage helped create a lighter-than-usual version of this benchmark Pinot, it's beautifully crafted and fully realized. Like Burgundy, it disguises its power in a framework of elegantly defined fruits, acids and polished tannins. Cherry, plum, peach pit, pineapple and lemon oil notes are all in the mix. It's a wine that invites contemplation and rewards your time and attention.",US,Pinot Noir,93,80.0
16841,Camphor and cedar oak aromas partially mask flavors that center around earth and pie cherries. The fruit is a little thin and the overlay of oak only emphasizes that.,New Zealand,Pinot Noir,82,

8963,"The aromatic opening includes a forest-like note, plus mineral and earthy berry scents. The palate feels chunky and wide, with solid tannins that don't bite or dominate. Flavors of herb, olive, spice, molasses and cassis are typical for the Alto Maipo, while the finish is defined by racy acids that should allow this wine to age nicely for another five-plus years.",Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,89,25.0
128259,"While there's some nice, honest fruit here, it's weighed down by heavy vanilla overtones. The finish is long enough but shows a confected element and winds up with a singed wood tone.",US,Chambourcin,80,14.0
114313,"This grower, based in Chamery on the Montagne de Reims, has produced a ripe creamy nonvintage wine. White-fruit aromas and apple-fruit flavors reinforce the richness of the wine. It has a crisp aftertaste that brings in acidity to balance. Drink now.",France,Champagne Blend,88,51.0

109164,"Another of the producer's estate-grown offerings, this vineyard-designate is bittersweet on the palate, rich and yet softly smooth in anise and waxy apple. Plenty of acidity buoys the experience, adding to the wine's ability to stay crisply refreshing on the finish.",US,Chardonnay,90,45.0
100258,"Coffee aromas and some delicate raspberry fruit come up immediately. At first the fruit seems over-matched, but give it some hours of breathing time and it fills out nicely, bringing on sweet cherry nuanced with fresh herbs.

113348,"Winemakers: Adi Badenhorst and Duncan Savage. A blend of 65% Shiraz, 27% Grenache and 8% Cinsault, this blend made by two friends is bright and vibrant, much like their personalities. The bouquet is brimming with fruity character, expressed in waves of boysenberry, blueberry and raspberry, all hit by accents of pressed purple violets and fresh fynbos. The medium-weight palate is full in body and flavor, with a texture like crushed velvet and lingering flavors of spiced berries and chewy chocolate brownie on the long, evolving finish. A baby right now, though delicious, it should age well through 2026.",South Africa,Rhône-style Red Blend,94,
108586,"A simple, diluted and somewhat intensely ripe white, this is youthful, still tense and one-dimensional.",US,Chardonnay,83,35.0
38622,"Subtle scents and flavors of dark berry, cedar and spice make this Pinotage both embraceable and friendly, though it's still full of the distinctive Pinotage smoke and rubber that tend to divide drinkers when it comes to this grape.

93801,"This light to medium weight Cabernet has the right profile, but just doesn't seem to come alive. The nose shows blackberry and tobacco aromas and in the mouth there are dried black cherry and spice notes, but they never shine. A soflty dry, slightly woody finish closes the package.",Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,82,11.0
20698,"A touch of flint meets yeasty, herbal notes of chervil and white pepper. The palate plays these two off each other and adds a generous dollop of pure, linear lemon zest to brighten and heighten everything. Lasting zestiness makes for an ultraclean, very refreshing finish on a very concentrated, taut body.",Austria,Grüner Veltliner,92,45.0
109669,"A nose of lemon and petrol opens into flavors of lemon, pears, petrol and white flowers, with slightly overpowering toast notes. Tannins are a bit stiff for an otherwise bright white that has a slightly tart finish.",Israel,Chardonnay,85,25.0

75421,"Basically characterized by gigantic fruit that leaves little to the imagination. Blackberries, cherries, cola and spicy plums explode in the mouth, and while the wine is technically dry, it's sweet in fruity essence. Oak adds caramel and vanilla.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,52.0
34265,"Cedary, spicy berry aromas are pure Rioja, but this also tosses in campfire, graphite and toast scents. A massive palate is concentrated and needs time to unfold.

108151,"While this wine is lean initially, it also shows weight and the potential of ripe fruits. Concentrated tannins still allow room for a little juicy fruit.

60783,"Dusty and peppery aromas alert you to the fact that this will be a lean, tight ride.

48286,"Valley of the Moon hasn't raised the price on this Bordeaux blend for years, which makes it a value for the complexity you get.

6459,"Deliciously perfumed, this shows some of the structure of the vintage, along with generous raspberry and red cherry flavors. It is rich and solid, and its open character has just the right edge of dense tannins. Already approachable, but it's likely to age over several years.",France,Pinot Noir,91,94.0
123319,"A nose of strawberry and mint with a whiff of petrol sets the scene for flavors of cassis, cherry preserves, peach and eucalyptus that never quite coalesce. Soft tannins drop off immediately after a burst of white peach at the finish.",Turkey,Kuntra,86,15.0

40812,"With its attractive aromas and flavors of ripe cherries and subtle notes of pine and dried mint, this wine is immediately accessible without being simple. Likewise, in terms of texture, it's sturdy enough to last a few years, but not so tough as to be off-putting. Complex, flavorful and supple, it should be at its best through at least 2016.",New Zealand,Pinot Noir,90,29.0
15570,"Though not labeled as such, this is truly a Red Mountain wine with all of the fruit coming from Ciel du Cheval and Taptiel vineyards.

79122,"Far less ripe and appealing than the 2004 version. The '05 comes out of the chute smelling malty and lactic; airing reveals strawberry milk notes, while the flavors struggle to express themselves.

10622,"With a healthy whack of Merlot (22%), this drinks a bit more like a Bordeaux blend than a varietal wine. It enchants with aromas of high-toned herbs, coffee, toasty oak and red cherry.

62777,"Aromas and flavors of sandalwood and grenadine layer around this velvety, seductive wine. It offers black tea, truffle and forest floor, the body sinewy and complex. Savory in cinnamon and clove on the finish, it needs more time to open; decant or cellar through 2021.",US,Pinot Noir,91,55.0
86635,"Despite coming from the Rocks District, the appellation doesn't seem to truly reveal itself on this blend of 75% Mourvèdre, 20% Grenache and 5% Syrah. Light in color, the aromas are bright, with notes of raspberry compote, cranberry, raw meat and green herb. The palate brings well-balanced red-fruit flavors, with the oak seeming dialed way back.

95146,"This is a lovely, lighthearted vineyard-designated wine. Soft, layered and decadent on the palate, it offers a mix of green apple, Meyer lemon, ginger and marshmallow.

102961,"Nicely balanced and firmly structured, this earthy red opens with classic Sangiovese aromas of tilled soil, pressed blue flower, red berry, herb and a whiff of game. The savory palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, tobacco and licorice accompanied by chewy tannins.",Italy,Sangiovese,93,75.0
78484,"This is a style of wine that offers a blockbuster view of Bordeaux. It is full of dark extracted fruits, brooding tannins, dark plum juice and a burnt feeling that comes from alcohol. In its style, it goes for excess.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86,35.0

4807,"It's a proper Pinot Noir in the silky texture and cherry and cola flavors, which finish smooth and dry. Other than that, it's rustic and heavy.",US,Pinot Noir,85,17.0
123472,"Eradus continues a successful run with this year's Sauvignon Blanc. As usual, it's fairly pungent and herbal upfront, but then delivers waves of passion fruit. It's concentrated and fairly full-bodied for a Sauvignon, with a lingering finish.",New Zealand,Sauvignon Blanc,91,20.0
17499,"Herb, red-berry, vanilla and cherry aromas are followed by reserved black-cherry flavors. It shows a lot of restraint.",US,Red Blend,89,35.0
47676,"Rooty aromas of raisin and stewed plum are a touch hot as this tips the scale at 15.5%. High in acidity and low in body fat, the palate is linear. Short berry and root beer flavors are mature. Hollow on the finish. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Red Blend,89,65.0
103526,Spine tingling acidity and sharp lemon and lime flavors mark this zesty dry Trebbiano. Crisp green apple and nectarine notes fill out the midpalate a bit. The finish is brisk and clean.,US,Trebbiano,86,22.0
78255,"For all the richness, and there's plenty of it in the pineapple, Meyer lemondrop and vanilla notes, this Chard has a gunmetal minerality that grounds it. The “Nu” designation indicates that it's unoaked.",US,Chardonnay,87,18.0
73900,"Labeled off dry but with little or no sweetness, this is a unique effort, a rosé style with unusual length and focus. Chill this wine and drink it as an apéritif. It is most unusual—dusty, musky, and concentrated, with a fine finish that resonates with a Grand Marnier note.",US,Black Muscat,88,10.0
61500,"This is a perfect go-to, everyday Chardonnay, solid and light, if a bit unexciting. The fruit flavors of apple and melon are gentle and soft, and the oak treatment delicately handled. You get a little bit of buttered popcorn, but it's not a night out at the movies.",US,Chardonnay,85,8.0
3793,"In just a few years 14 Hands Riesling production has jumped from around 15,000 to more than 700,000 cases. Clearly the brand is doing something that consumers love.

23795,"Fully ripe, almost stewy aromas of raisin, prune and blackberry are soft and friendly. That's more or less the theme with this wine; the palate is cushioned and dense, while a loamy set of jammy berry and chocolate flavors finish with raisiny sweetness and a licorice note.",Argentina,Malbec,88,18.0
54487,"Very dry and tannic. Treads the line between elegant and boring. Some good cherry and blackberry flavors erupt midpalate, but it's really a fairly lean, earthy Cabernet. The score reflects where it could end up in, say, eight years.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,35.0
22960,"The wine has simple red-berry flavors and a light layer of tannins. The acidity is probably too intense—a product of the vintage. But it is an attractive wine to drink now, finishing with its crisp aftertaste.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,86,45.0
110792,"This light and fruity wine offers fresh peach flavors, with a burst of lemon candy. It's off dry and finishes with a sugary kick.",US,Riesling,85,18.0
128264,"For a wine that's 100% Mourvèdre, this has pretty tame tannins, the suppleness and creamy texture helping to balance some of the crisp acids and tart red berry notes. Varietal cola and tree bark aromas and flavors add complexity to this structured but approachable red that should drink well for at least the next 5–8 years.",Australia,Mourvèdre,89,35.0
11102,"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Grande Vidure, 20% Petite Syrah and 10% Merlot, it is as if you can clearly account for each varietal's contribution. Ripe cassis, cherry, plum, and spice flavors are buttressed by well-integrated oak.  Beautifully balanced, it has good acidity and mature tannins, and closes with a long, satisfying finish. Great wine for tonight's grilled T-bone, and worthy of mid-term cellaring .",Chile,Red Blend,91,40.0

122231,"From a high altitude estate in the Vaucluse, this blend of 60% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 5% Cinsault is pale and coppery in hue, yet shows ample richness and weight on the palate. Notes of wet stone, berry and citrus linger on the mouthwatering finish.",France,Rosé,88,30.0
83694,"Basically a clean, light, simple white with a flat/soft body and pithy, dry flavors of citrus and melon rind. Shows some bitterness on the finish along with a flash of white heat. Decent at best. Drink right away.",Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,84,10.0

109739,"There's a brooding quality to the smoky, diesel-fuel like aromas of this wine, but that's left in the rearview by ripe flavors of honey and baked apple once it's in the mouth. This wine is round and atypically soft for the vintage, but picks up some lively lime notes on the finish.",Germany,Riesling,89,41.0
118868,"Tasted from a half bottle, the rich and complex flavors of Brut La Française show just that extra touch of maturity.

61034,"Penfolds' entry-level Chardonnay is a medium-bodied, easy-drinking wine with modest fig and anise notes. Drink up.",Australia,Chardonnay,84,11.0
36198,"From a vineyard in the Fort Ross-Seaview appellation, this is clearly one of the best wines of the vintage. The mouthfeel is light and silky, with refined tannins that give it a slight astringency. The flavors are vast and complex with raspberries, cherries and cola, but also forest notes of mushrooms, balsam and herbs. The acidity is fresh and appealing. It's gorgeous now, and should evolve over the next 15 years.",US,Pinot Noir,96,48.0

30405,"Aromas suggest toasted oak, espresso, roasted coffee bean and mocha. The warm, concentrated palate offers prune, cherry steeped in spirits, allspice and oak extract alongside assertive tannins, with the heat of alcohol on the midpalate. The fruit richness is drying up fast so drink soon.",Italy,Negroamaro,87,20.0

21221,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot come together to offer black currant and vanilla aromas in this dense Bolgheri red. The palate doles out ripe black plum and cedar-inflected tobacco flavors, set against fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2020.",Italy,Red Blend,89,60.0
102668,"A blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Merlot and 3% each of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, this wine tastes of charred wood and generic red juice, accented by a slight green character. Puckering tannins and a diluted finish complete the picture.",US,Meritage,83,50.0
93678,"This smells mulchy at first, then more like tomato and earthy leather. The palate is big and blocky, with herbal, mildly stewed flavors of tomato, berry and spiced plum. It's earthy on the finish, with a clove accent.",Argentina,Cabernet Sauvignon,84,12.0
116245,"Briny citrus, feline notes and pithy scents send this Merseguera-led blend toward a pulpy, citrusy palate. Grapefruit and pithy, lightly bitter flavors finish citric, with little change from the wine's primary flavors.",Spain,White Blend,85,9.0
73567,"Oaked up at all points, but still a good basic blend of two friendly grapes. Shows cherry and raspberry aromas along with graphite and barrel spice on the bouquet.

37328,"Seems as though St. Lucas's white wines are more sturdy than its reds. This Chard is fleshy and won't last much longer, but for dense melon, peach and cider-like flavors and relatively good balance, it's making the grade. Plump and tropical on the finish as it battles to stay in line.",Argentina,Chardonnay,85,11.0
28574,"The wine is fantastic, albeit tannic. It's not a gushy one to open tonight. The tannins have a dry astringency, but even so, you can taste fabulously ripe blackberries, black cherries and currants. This wine should begin to come into its own next year and hold for many years.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,94,44.0
49856,"Held back all these years, this Bordeaux-style blend is just beginning to shed its fresh, primary raspberry and cherry flavors. In their place are drier versions of the same, with hints of mushrooms and violets. The wine is a little soft, but certainly delicious, and is drinking well now.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,88,30.0
15775,"Sheer in texture, this honeyed nectar falls on the palate like a whisper, but its stone fruit, red berry and grapefruit flavors are powerful and compounding. Multifaceted with touches of sugar cookie and guava juxtaposed with lime zest and slate, it delivers a long, ponderous finish.",Germany,Riesling,95,50.0
55636,"There have been 19 (dix-neuf) generations of Mellots making wine in Sancerre; at least one of them in each generation has been named Alphonse. This wine celebrates the history and the great quality of the family's wines today. It is richly endowed with both the beautifully ripe fruit and with a sophisticated acidity and texture. Drink this very fine wine now, although, like the Mellots, it will also age.",France,Sauvignon Blanc,93,75.0

22497,"Winemaker Kathy Joseph delivers this seven-barrel ode to her father, who'd be proud of the tight blackberry, wet clay, shaved cedar and iron-rich aromas.

20641,"Made from 100% Muscat di Canelli grapes, retaining 9.5% residual sugar, this is a perfumed dessert wine, reminiscent of Gewürztraminer in its lychee aromas. It remains balanced and light on the palate, not overly sweet.",US,Moscato,88,25.0
114545,"From one of the great Douro estates, this dense, intensely perfumed wine is just setting out on a long journey. Tannins and a complex structure give an initial impression of dryness.

105365,"Earthy aromas lead to a wine that is still young and tannic, firm with a dry core and dark-chocolate flavors. It will be a concentrated wine as it develops, so wait until 2017.",France,Provence red blend,87,22.0

81920,"This wine envelopes the senses and coats the mouth with its honey and ripe yellow fruit flavors. It's rich and unctuous yet has the acidity and poise typical of the vineyards in the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains. Young now, it will age. Drink from 2019.",France,Petit Manseng,92,32.0
76110,"Guidalberto (a 60-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) opens with dense, inky concentration and fresh tones of forest fruit and wild blackberry. The wine is bright and silky with a fresh cherry fade: Pair it with spezzatino di manzo (classic beef stew).",Italy,Red Blend,91,45.0
114831,"Great price for a Cabernet this nice. It's dry, smooth and classic in blackberry and currant flavors, with a deft touch of smoky oak. Just a bit too acidic; a rich steak will help.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,87,12.0
123716,"A selection from a single plot of 40- to 70-year-old vines, this full-bodied wine is juicy with a tight texture that comes from the terroir. It offers a crisp edge as well as bright acidity, the apple fruits lifted further by a lemon streak. Drink from 2019.",France,Chardonnay,89,25.0
67379,"The brilliant deep-ruby color is a harbinger of things to come. The aromas are cherry, spice and a not unpleasant small amount of Bret. The palate feel is good and the finish long. The tannins just need a little time to soften. This should be perfect by 2002.",Italy,Red Blend,89,38.0

38459,"There's something almost Grenache-like in the flavors here, which are focused, youthful and packed with ripe red fruits. It's tart and well-tempered, and lingers gracefully.

44819,"Bunan's 18th-century castle is called Belle Raisin—Bélouvé in the old Provençal dialect (beautiful grapes in English).

3871,"The Thanisch wines from the Doctor vineyard rarely stand out in our magazine's blind tastings, making their value proposition questionable. That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special. At only 7.5% abv, you'd expect an intensely sweet wine, but the sugars are amply buffered by acids and minerality, so the overall impression is one of richness without excessive weight rather than sugary sweetness.",Germany,Riesling,91,84.0

Drink 2017–2025.",Italy,Red Blend,91,
105549,"This is a rich, heavy wine, a Chardonnay on steroids. It's packed with ripe and lush tree fruits, and those flavors are matched with generous barrel toast.

62245,"Smells great and flashy, with inviting notes of blackberries, black currants, green olives and spicy sandalwood. Candied and sweet in the mouth, with blackberry and black cherry fruit.

Drink from 2021.",France,Malbec,92,25.0

51820,"Cherry and plum, chocolate and peppery herbs combine here in a well-structured wine with some years of life ahead. Aged in one-third new French oak for 11 months, it will reward decanting or aeration if you are drinking it in the next year or two.",Canada,Pinot Noir,89,40.0
73288,"Ripe tropical fruit and oak dominate this overly sweet Chardonnay. It's very rich in pineapple tart, golden mango, buttered toast and crème brûlée flavors, but lacks dry balance. Tastes like there's a lot of white sugar in there.",US,Chardonnay,84,32.0
81384,"Smells hot and rubbery,  cherry cola-like and syrupy, not a good sign. In the mouth, it's awkwardly sweet and gluey, with the flavor of sweetened rose hip tea, and fairly hefty tannins. Not going anywhere. —S.H.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,82,13.0
87304,"Unfined, unfiltered, wood aged, this wine was created as a tribute to old-style Sancerre. With its intensity and definite wood aging character, it is certainly different.

59334,"Charred aromas top this dark-fruited, high-quality Bobal from central Spain.

83508,"Gotta hand it to Trivento, Concha y Toro's Argentine operation: their wines are consistent from year to year. Once again, the Select Chardonnay features a smooth, buttery nose and a well-oaked but healthy palate. It's woody for sure, but there's lemony balance. We wouldn't call this stately or great, but it gets the job done at $11.",Argentina,Chardonnay,86,11.0

54534,"An opaque color suggests power and density, and for the most part that's what you get. Jammy, raisiny aromas culminate with prune and berry pie scents.

95468,"From old vines within the Fanucchi Wood Road Vineyard in the heart of the appellation, this is a rare bottling of a variety more commonly found in the Jura, but acquiring new fans in California, especially made at this high level.

19734,"Camphor, espresso and black-skinned berry lead the nose while the delicious palate offers crushed black raspberry, orange peel, white pepper, chopped herb and a hint of star anise. It's tightly wound with youthfully firm but elegant tannins. Drink 2018–2024.",Italy,Nebbiolo,92,67.0
15011,"Crisp, mineral and tight, this is still a young bottling. It is dry, full of citrus-fruit flavors and with a fine burst of acidity that cuts through the wine.

34698,"Dark and delicious, this wine pulls everything together for a flavorful, even graceful character that's not at all oaky.

It's deep and impressive, showing tiers of complexity, but it's also very tannic, with a dry, astringent kick that makes it seemingly undrinkable now.

77705,"Certain Argentine wines have a rustic, foxy character to them that reminds us that winemaking isn't a factory-proven science. This fits the bill; it's murky and sharp on the nose, with brambly raspberry sitting in wait. Feelwise, it's a bit too piercing and choppy.",Argentina,Malbec,83,16.0

13282,"An intoxicating whiff of musky floral perfume persists throughout this bright, full-bodied Sauvignon Blanc.

45234,"This has been an interesting wine from Niner. Last year's bottling was terrific. So's this 2006.

22901,"Champoux is one of Washington's most revered vineyards, known especially for the rich, black cherry fruit on display here.

It's drinking nicely, and should be consumed near term for best enjoyment.",US,Merlot,88,50.0

15212,"One of the iconic wines of Portugal, the brand dates back to the 15th century and the Portuguese discovery of Brazil. In its latest incarnation, it is hugely dense and concentrated. It could be that it is too much, with dark extracts, yet somehow the super-ripe plum and berry flavors are given enough freshness. The structure is all there in what is still a young wine.

Best to drink soon.",Chile,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,14.0
20988,"Showing its age, but unfortunately not very well, this wine has lost any semblance of freshness, with notes of overripe lemons, stone fruit, pressed buttercups and buttered green beans.

Give this one plenty of air for best results.",Spain,Sherry,91,18.0

127222,"This estate beauty offers a depth of cola spice and lovely acidity, with just a hint of underlying richness.

61865,"Ripe and fruity, this red-berry flavored wine has good acidity and a crisp, bright texture. The tannins are now well integrated into the fruit, giving a structured, yet fresh, aftertaste.

97211,"The delicate structure on this Pinot immediately appeals. It's all silk and satin, gliding across the palate with mouthwateringly crisp acidity that gets you ready for rich fare, like steak, tuna, lamb. A dried thyme earthiness suggests its warmer Napa origin, but the strawberry and cranberry fruit is evocative. Drink now.",US,Pinot Noir,86,60.0
99617,"Wonderfully ripe notions of juicy, yellow pear rise from the glass. The same fruity freshness is joined on the palate by a good pinch of white pepper.

103476,"This is a really fantastic wine and one of the best expression of Falanghina available today. (Perhaps the best.) What sets it apart is the purity of its fruit aromas.

118238,"A new, reserve-level wine from the producer's estate Winside Vineyard, Laura is both floral and sauvage, spicy, dense and full-figured.

82329,"Father-and-son vintners Joe and Sam Miller consistently deliver solid wines, including this twist-top Merlot that's aged in 50% new French oak.

That pyrazine touch hits the palate, along with black pepper and dark chocolate spice, accenting the tangy red fruit.",US,Merlot,90,35.0
31196,"This is one of the most forward and accessible of Calera's new releases. It's superrich now in black cherry liqueur, mocha, licorice, bacon and spice flavors, a seductively silky wine that's a total hedonistic pleasure.

118523,"If you aren't familiar with Ripasso (a hybrid wine that borrows elements from austere Amarone and informal Valpolicella), this selection from Bolla is an excellent introductory wine.

113013,"Dry, restrained and a bit mouthpuckering with tannins and acidity, this needs to pair with antipasti like Italian salumi. Its lean texture and tart cherry and cranberry flavors do make it appetizing and help it stand out from the crowd of simply ripe California reds.",US,Sangiovese,86,18.0
41211,"Chunky and clunky on the nose, and unlike previous vintages, this one requires more patience and a willingness to overlook some flaws. For starters, the wine has a milky nose. It's frankly gaseous and bretty. But give it time to unwind and blackberry and standard plum flavors step in. The finish is easygoing, but all along there's a narrowness to it. Good but not as good as in the past.",Argentina,Bonarda,84,11.0

Everything is balanced and forward, but you get the sense that this wine is holding something back for the future.",US,Merlot,91,36.0

76205,"This wine is drinking well right now, benefiting from the tertiary qualities that come from bottle age yet remaining fresh and lively.

Bone dry, it bears classic blackberry and black currant flavors. It will develop over the next six years, but is drinkable now.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,93,100.0
126511,"The 2008 vintage was cool and resulted in lighter-bodied wines that also were lower in alcohol. That trend benefited wines like this lovely one from Regale.

26654,"From an 850-foot-elevation site four miles from the ocean, this offers a depth of dark cherry and Asian spice, lightly bodied and textured. It delivers a hit of bittersweet chocolate on the tangy finish, with an intriguing streak of charcuterie that's hard to shake.",US,Pinot Noir,91,56.0

123761,"Of the three Cherubino 2010 Cabernets, I slightly preferred this one (the blended version), but just by a hair. The nose boasts seductive aromas of cedar, smoke, brown sugar and maple syrup, backed up on the palate by a convergence of chocolaty and meaty flavors that end in a softly dusty finale.

101329,"Finished in French oak, the Magnifique bottling from Walter Dacon seems a bit plain, almost generic in this vintage.

62571,"Crisp as it should be, with fit aromas of apple, fresh lettuce and honey.

Quite satisfying and fairly serious given its under-$15 provenance.",Spain,Sparkling Blend,88,14.0
16883,"This Merlot seems a bit lean, with herbal notes on the nose that give the wine's chocolaty richness a hint of carob instead. Dark cherries and vanilla pick up on that herbal note in the mouth, with the vanilla intensifying on the finish. Drink now.",US,Merlot,85,18.0

83356,"This is the only Cayuse Syrah that is co-fermented (with 8% Viognier), which adds nuances of white flower and floral, though the citrus rind scents override them. In the nose it's hugely expressive, though still quite tight and compact in the mouth; it must be decanted. It's a three ring circus of a wine, with things moving and shaking in all directions.

29832,"Bell pepper and citrus aromas control the nose on this racy wine that clocks in at only 12% abv. An alert, tangy palate matches the nose, while this tastes of lemon-lime, tart green apple and sea brine. A lean, high-acid finish stops short of tasting green.",Chile,Sauvignon Blanc,88,
77864,"On the lean side, this is a tense, severe wine that offers few flavors at this stage. It's hard, and the wood and tannins dominate the fruit. It's always likely to be firm, although an attractive smokiness will become pleasant in 2–3 years.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,85,16.0

78937,"Normally a blending wine, because on its own this varietal offers sweetness and frangrance without accompanying body and depth, and this wine shows why.

55841,"The winery offers this bottling as a counterpart to their dry Riesling, but there's not much separation between the two. Its 10 g/L of residual sugar is certainly above threshhold, but with the searingly tart acidity underneath, it barely makes a dent. Citrus and apple flavors come through, but the sour lemon acidity is what dominates.",US,Riesling,87,22.0

28573,"Astralis has become one of Australia's top collectibles, and Roman Bratasiuk's 2005 version is once again top-shelf stuff. It's full-bodied and rich without being over the top, balancing dark-chocolate-covered blackberries and blueberries with more complex savory notes (spice, grilled meat).

Roasted coffee bean and powdered sage notes mark the finish.",Italy,Nebbiolo,89,46.0
11899,"Because it is crafted from old vines from a single parcel, this wine has been released a year later than usual for Muscadet.

85479,"This top wine from Lamartine is a fine, solid expression of the firm nature of young Malbec. It has dark, dense black fruits layered behind the dry, tight tannins. With this concentration, this is a wine that needs to age. Leave until 2020.",France,Malbec,92,23.0
46846,"Young, tannic and juicy, filled with sweet blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors, and well oaked, having been aged in 100% new French barrels. Those are the raw facts. The wine itself shows the pedigree of this fine estate, and will no doubt pick up bottle nuances over the years. But it seems to lack the precision of the great 2001, 2003 and 2004 vintages.

80805,"Pinched on the nose but solid in terms of aromas: blackberry, cassis and a touch of oak come together well.

118274,"Both the golden color and the advanced nose signal a mature wine. The nose has a lifted quality that references white sultanas, dried pineapple, chalk and cooked champignons, with sumptuous, pleasantly bitter notes of dark fir honey. Contrary to expectation, the palate is merely off dry. It has an intriguing, almost salty quality with inflections of soy-sauce savoriness and immense depth of flavor. Still is sprightly and fresh, the wine has a streak of lemon freshness at its core. Lovely now and mature, it can be enjoyed until at least 2020.",France,Gewürztraminer,93,66.0

93900,"Although the label doesn't say what grapes were used to make “wine for BBQ,” the deep color, structure and leafy green aromas suggest a meaty, hefty grape (it's actually a blend of Sangiovese and Montepulciano). The wine has power, heft and simple fruit flavors.",Italy,Red Blend,86,11.0

37378,"This is 100% Syrah from the Boushey vineyard. It's so compact that it's almost impenetrable, but the gorgeous aromas portend a glorious wine given appropriate bottle age and/or breathing time. A dark, dusty mix of black fruits, black olives, black coffee and licorice, this has such density that it's almost impossible to separate out all the fruit layers, let alone the earthier components that make it so distinctive. At 14.8% alcohol, this may be the biggest Betz Boushey Syrah ever.",US,Syrah,94,55.0

51016,"Appealing modern-leaning aromas of root beer, berry fruits and vanilla settle with airing and turn more mellow and traditional for Rioja.

124603,"This is estate grown, from a Lake Chelan winery in an emerging region. Riesling is clearly a strength, as this has a delicate elegance often missing from the fruit bombs that can be grown in warmer sites. Bone dry, dusty and lightly floral in the nose.

47029,"On the toasty, oaky side, but with just enough citrus and melon fruit to support it, this is a creamy, lush rendition of Saint-Péray that does a nice job integrating the oak into the body of the wine.

87779,"Full-flavoured, almost heady notes of tart strawberry, crunchy red cherry and fresh lemon pervade nose and palate perfectly. This is a real mouthful of flavor, yet light and zippy.

62258,". A delightfully intriguing “White Burgundy” blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Meunier, the last an unexpected surprise, the fruit sourced from both the Sangiacomo and Yountmill vineyards.

93346,"This bears blackberry, black currant and cherry liqueur flavors, and the 12% Syrah component seems to bring a peppery roasted-meat note. Although the wine is technically dry, it's a little warm and sweet in glycerine—the result of high alcohol. Drink now.",US,Red Blend,87,28.0

81511,"This brand new, crisp and fresh wine is so young. Even a rosé can benefit from a few months aging, and this wine with its tight red fruits and lightly tannic texture will be better being drunk after the summer when its fruitiness will explode in the mouth. It is ripe, light and packed with acidity at the end.",France,Rosé,87,22.0

126643,"The cheery, cartoonish cat gracing the label of this off-dry Riesling belies the unexpected elegance of the wine within. The palate is unabashedly peachy and forward, boasting a lush, rounded mouthfeel, but it's also quite mineral, accenting ripe fruit with tones of chalk and wet stone.

81939,"This is an unusual limited-production wine from Perdigão's highest hottest vineyard. It is not often to find a 100% Alfrocheiro despite being native to the Dão region. The strongly tannic wine, which spent 12 months in wood, is intensely perfumed with hedgerow flowers and mint while full of dark plum-skin flavors. It has power and concentration and is likely to remain very firm into the future. Drink now or take a risk and cellar.",Portugal,Alfrocheiro,92,34.0
95728,"This is a herbal, earthy wine with as many tannins as fruit at this stage. That gives it a dense, dusty texture that seeps into the ripe, sweet plum flavors. With the wood giving an extra push of richness as well as spice, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.",Portugal,Portuguese Red,89,7.0
17507,"Typical of Egon Müller's wines, this is light in body, but titanium-strong in structure, welding rather tart, lemony fruit to stony, minerally notes and embellishing it all with the merest hints of riper, apple-y fruit.

75939,"This is the most expensive Pinot Noir Foxen has ever made, and guess what? It's also the winery's best. It bears rich flavors, offering tiers of smoky cherries, red currants, licorice candies, vanilla, sandalwood and spices. What's harder to describe is the sheer beauty of the texture and balance. Containing the explosive richness of a wine like this is a challenge, but winemaker Bill Wathan has managed to bring elegance to its power.

28990,"This wine is fruity, with only a light texture of acidity and stalky black currant fruit flavors. From the difficult 2013 vintage, it is lit with acidity and fresh fruit at the end. Drink now.

67231,"A fine, ripe and soft blend of Duras and Braucol, this is a wine that's made to drink young for its fruit. There is a dry background to the fruitiness although it is the red-fruit flavors and balanced acidity that shine. Drink from early 2018.",France,Red Blend,87,19.0
98699,"Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, French oak and a whiff of new leather lift out of the glass.

Drink 2020–2025.",Italy,Sangiovese,92,160.0
62242,"Light-bodied and lithe, this is not as fruity or flashy as many of its brethren from this vintage.

Give it some time in the cellar, where it should blossom in another 5–7 years.",Germany,Riesling,90,47.0

11505,"Bolinas-based Sean Thackrey's new project, Cassiopeia is centered on one block from a single Anderson Valley vineyard. His quest was to see what four different Pinot Noir clones on one rootstock, all the same age, and treated otherwise similarly, could become once turned into wine.

77447,"Run by the Nony family who also own Château Caronne Ste Gemme, this well-made wine has taken advantage of the fruitiness of the vintage. Ripe fruit is the hallmark here, juicy blackberry and soft tannins rounded by some wood aging. Drink from 2017.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89,24.0

46763,"In northeast Italy (in this case Alto Adige) they don't use the “Blanc” qualifier, but this is definitely SB. Lemon and mineral qualities are strong on the nose and in the mouth, while driving acids create a mouth-watering feel.

54193,"The wine has a lively mousse along with crisp acidity. Unusually for a rosé, the blend is 90% Chardonnay, the color coming from the addition of red wine (normal in Champagne).

A sip enlivens the mouth and wipes clean on the finish.",US,Pinot Noir,90,60.0
24338,"Lively aromas of grapefruit, white flowers and mineral lead into a light, fruity but rather simple palate that offers lime, green herb and stone. Overall it's straightforward and clean, but a touch dilute. In its favor, it's soft and easy to drink.",France,Sauvignon Blanc,86,30.0

8304,"The rather closed nose gives little away. The palate, however, is full of juicy stone fruit. Think ripe mirabelle and apricot, think juicy tangerine and orange. This is full of fruit and tension, highlighted with lemon freshness and a lovely streamlined taut palate. The long finish has something of fresh apples about it.",Austria,Riesling,92,50.0
50883,"Tangerines abound throughout this intensely perfumed, concentrated wine. Dry in style, it's refreshingly citrusy, yet streaked with wet stone, petrol and struck flint. While deft and light bodied, it's persistent through a long, pleasantly astringent finish.",US,Riesling,90,24.0

87293,"This bottling masterfully handles the young appellation's tropically inclined fruit, with apple candy aromas and a soft, rich mouthfeel.

59611,"You can taste the warm Paso Robles sunshine in every sip of this exuberant Cabernet. It brims with jammy blackberries, black cherries and chocolate, yet the finish is dry. Be aware of quite high alcohol, though, that gives it prickly heat.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,29.0
55431,"Much lighter than the winery's other bottling of this level, this wine shows cranberry, light olive and the slightest hint of eucalyptus on the nose.

125303,"Opulent and ripe, this is a powerful, wood-aged wine. It has a fine mix of tropical fruits, spice and vanilla. The richness is cut through with pink grapefruit to give a fine sense of poise and balance. Age for at least four years.",France,Bordeaux-style White Blend,94,
70734,"Aromas of clamshell, tree bark and berry fruits are scattereshot. This has a noticeably sticky, syrupy feel along with candied, sweet flavors of black plum and baking spices. A chunky, sticky, sweet-tasting finish lacks cut and finesse.",Chile,Pinot Noir,83,8.0
121734,"Fairly light aromas of red cherry juice, licorice and dried violets show on the nose, following by a rather light density on the palate as well. Hints of minty cherry and charred wood also arise, as do grippy tannins that vanish quickly.",US,Merlot,84,36.0

34602,"The blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah mixes notes of black cherries with hints of red raspberries to create a delicious tension.

30738,"Noticeable alcohol gives this Zin both heat and apparent sweetness. Combined with a superripe fruit flavor that veers into raisin territory, it turns rustic. Drink it with barbecue.",US,Zinfandel,85,30.0
122559,"One sip is all it takes to fall in love with this 100% Cabernet, which hails from the winery's Stags Leap District vineyards. It's soft, lush and opulent in blackberry, cherry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. Although it was aged in 100% new French oak, the oak isn't at all heavy. Rather, it's perfect, adding just the right touch of smoke. Really fabulous, and the tannins define Stags Leap, so strong yet sweetly refined. If you can keep your hands off it, this is a wine to cellar for many years.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,97,195.0
44565,"Orange marmalade and orgeat syrup hint at the sweeter side of this wine, but there is also a sharp and interesting line of chopped basil and cut scallions on the nose.

112677,"Another fine 9-3-5 Cabernet from Hunnicutt. The numbers symbolize the proprietors' wedding date. It's a splendid wine, if a little too young. Toasty oak and tannins dominate, but way underneath is a vast, sweet network of blackberries and black currants. You can certainly decant it for a few hours and enjoy now, but this is a wine that should age seriously for a good 8, 10, 12 years. It's a blend of St. Helena, Rutherford and Oakville fruit.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon,94,90.0

47241,"Medicinality, animal notes and rubbery scents interfere with this magenta-colored Monastrell's berry aromas. Scratchy and somewhat abrasive on the palate, with high acidity, this tastes of herbal plum and medicinal raspberry, with a gripping finish.",Spain,Monastrell,84,12.0
126515,"A great, upscale wine to drink now with the best you can pair it with. It shows classic Napa character, with firm, dry tannins, fine acidity and blackberry and black currant flavors.

It's brisk, straightforward and primary in style, yet undeniably refreshing and quaffable.",US,Sauvignon Blanc,88,16.0
99513,"This rich but dry wine brings out Grüner Veltliner's peppery character, which shows on top of the pear and quince flavors. The acidity offers a lift to this intense, concentrated wine.",Austria,Grüner Veltliner,89,29.0

109769,"From a two-acre parcel of vines planted in 1950, this is a finely perfumed, rich wine. It has generous red fruits and an equally opulent ripe character.

The length and definition are most impressive.",US,Grüner Veltliner,91,32.0
47368,"A bright, fresh Syrah delicious in restrained blackberry and blueberry fruit, it has a luscious mouthfeel, plenty of acidity and an undercurrent of wild herb.

103272,"This is always a gigantic wine, and its success depends on technically balancing its various parts. The 2010 delivers the usual richness, with vast, deep fruit, mineral, oak and leesy flavors. It's as full bodied as a red wine, but a little heavy for a Chardonnay.

129138,"This complex wine lists no fewer than eight different clones in the blend, harvested at an average of just 1.8 tons/acre. The winery suggests that it is their most ageworthy Pinot Noir, and the structure of this young wine would support that assertion. It's tight, hard, compact with black fruits, smoke and chewy tannins. It's a wine that needs time to stretch its considerable muscles.

15802,"There's a lemony leanness to this exquisite wine, from one of the most esteemed vineyards in its region, a site the producer has worked with for more than 20 years.

32253,"Preserved mandarins are evoked on the nose. The palate continues this rich and luscious but zesty citrus game: tangerine, clementine and orange weave their sweet-tart aromatic course across the palate and into your heart. This has lovely richness but not an ounce of fat. Streamlined Riesling freshness bathes rich late harvest sweetness in bright refreshing light. The zesty finish makes you crave more. Drink now through 2030.",France,Riesling,94,55.0
57586,"Cranberry and clove swirl into a decadently spiced nose on this single-vineyard expression from veteran winemakers Dick Dore and Billy Wathen. The wine delivers more complexity on the palate, with touches of raspberry, allspice and cardamon.",US,Pinot Noir,93,62.0

81859,"An elegant, complex 100% Cab, solid and potent, although it's also young and fresh in tannins and needs time in the cellar.
